.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm top
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl w
.Op Fl k
.Op Fl s Ar interval
.Op Fl e | Fl d
.Op Ar number
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm top 
displays an ongoing sample of system usage statistics.  It operates
in various different modes, but by default shows cpu utilization and
memory usage for each process in the system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u
When the
.Fl u
option is specified, processes are first sorted by cpu usage 
and then displayed starting with the highest consumers.
.It Fl w
Specifying the
.Fl w
option generates additional columns in the output producing
a much wider display of data. The additional columns include
VPRVT and RALIAS, along with the delta columns for #PRTS,
RSIZE and VSIZE (see descriptions following).
.It Fl k
The
.Fl k
option causes
.Nm top
to traverse and report the memory object map for pid 0
(the kernel task).  It is optional because it is fairly
expensive to traverse the object maps and the kernel
task may have a huge number of entries.
.It Fl s
By default,
.Nm top
updates its output at two second intervals. This sampling
interval may be changed by specifying the
.Fl s
option.  Enter the
.Ar interval
in seconds.
.It Fl e
Using the
.Fl e
option switches from the default output to an event counting
mode where the counts reported are absolute counters.  The
.Fl w
and
.Fl k
options are ignored when running in event counting mode.
.It Fl d
Using the
.Fl d
option switches from the default output to an event counting
mode where the counts are reported as deltas relative to
the previous sample.
The
.Fl w
and
.Fl k
options are ignored when running in event counting, delta mode.
.It number
If you wish to limit the number of processes displayed by
.Nm top,
specify the desired 
.Ar number
of output lines in this last argument.
.El
.Pp
The columns displayed in the default data mode are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width VSIZE(deltadelta) -compact
.Pp
.It PID
the Unix process id.
.It COMMAND
the Unix command name.
.It %CPU
the percentage of cpu consumed (kernel and user).
.It TIME
the absolute cpu consumption (min:secs.hundreths).
.It #TH
the number of threads.
.It #PRTS(delta)
the number of mach ports.
.It #MREG
the number of memory regions.
.It VPRVT(-w only)
the private address space currently allocated.
.It RPRVT
the resident private memory.
.It RALIAS(-w only)
the resident private memory (multiple allocations
coalesced into a single object).
.It RSHD
the resident shared memory (as represented by the
resident page count of each memory object).
.It RSIZE(delta)
the total resident memory (real pages that this
process currently has associated with it.  Some
may be shared by other processes).
.It VSIZE(delta)
the total address space currently allocated (including shared).
.El
.Pp
The delta columns are enabled by the
.Fl w
option.  The deltas for #PRTS and VSIZE are relative
to the numbers observed when
.Nm top
was launched.  The delta for RSIZE is relative to
the previous sample.
.Pp
The columns displayed in the event counting mode (ie: -e | -d options) 
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width MACHSYSCALL -compact
.Pp
.It PID
the Unix process id.
.It COMMAND
the Unix command name.
.It %CPU
the percentage of cpu consumed (kernel and user).
.It TIME
the absolute cpu consumption (min:secs.hundreths).
.It PAGEINS
the number of requests for pages from a pager.
.It FAULTS
the number of page faults.
.It COW_FAULTS
the number of faults that caused a page to be copied (generally
caused by copy-on-write faults).
.It MSGS_SENT
the number of mach messages sent by the process.
.It MSGS_RCVD
the number of mach messages received by the process.
.It BSDSYSCALL
the number of BSD system calls made by the process.
.It MACHSYSCALL
the number of MACH system calls made by the process.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm top
command also displays some global state in the first few lines of output,
including load averages, process and thread counts and memory breakdowns.
The
.Nm top
command is also SIGWINCH savvy, so adjusting your window geometry may change
the number of processes and number of columns displayed.
.Sh SAMPLE USAGE
.Pp
top -u -s5 20
.Pp
.Nm top
will sort the processes according to cpu usage, update the output at 5 
second intervals, and limit the display to the top 20 processes.
