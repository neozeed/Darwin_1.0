Debian packaging manual - chapter 2<br>
Binary packages
</h1>

The binary package has two main sections.  The first part consists of
various control information files and scripts used by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> when
installing and removing.  See <A href="#s-controlarea">Package control information files, section 2.2</A>.<P>

The second part is an archive containing the files and directories to
be installed. <P>

In the future binary packages may also contain other components, such
as checksums and digital signatures. The format for the archive is
described in full in the <code>deb(5)</code> manpage.

<h2><A name="s-bincreating">
2.1 Creating package files - <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd>
</A></h2>

All manipulation of binary package files is done by <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd>;
it's the only program that has knowledge of the format.
(<kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd> may be invoked by calling <kbd>dpkg</kbd>, as <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will
spot that the options requested are appropriate to <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd> and
invoke that instead with the same arguments.)<P>

In order to create a binary package you must make a directory tree
which contains all the files and directories you want to have in the
filesystem data part of the package.  In Debian-format source packages
this directory is usually <code>debian/tmp</code>, relative to the top of
the package's source tree.<P>

They should have the locations (relative to the root of the directory
tree you're constructing) ownerships and permissions which you want
them to have on the system when they are installed.<P>

With current versions of <kbd>dpkg</kbd> the uid/username and gid/groupname
mappings for the users and groups being used should be the same on the
system where the package is built and the one where it is installed.<P>

You need to add one special directory to the root of the miniature
filesystem tree you're creating: <kbd>DEBIAN</kbd>.  It should contain the
control information files, notably the binary package control file
(see <A href="#s-controlfile">The main control information file: <code>control</code>, section 2.3</A>).<P>

The <kbd>DEBIAN</kbd> directory will not appear in the filesystem archive of
the package, and so won't be installed by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> when the package
is installed.<P>

When you've prepared the package, you should invoke:
<pre>dpkg --build <var>directory</var></pre><P>

This will build the package in <code></code><var>directory</var><code>.deb</code>.
(<kbd>dpkg</kbd> knows that <code>--build</code> is a <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd> option, so it
invokes <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd> with the same arguments to build the package.)<P>

See the manpage <code>dpkg-deb(8)</code> for details of how
to examine the contents of this newly-created file.  You may find the
output of following commands enlightening:
<pre>dpkg-deb --info <var>filename</var>.deb
dpkg-deb --contents <var>filename</var>.deb
dpkg --contents <var>filename</var>.deb</pre>
To view the copyright file for a package you could use this command:
<pre>dpkg --fsys-tarfile <var>filename</var>.deb | tar xof usr/doc/<var>\*</var>copyright | less</pre>

<h2><A name="s-controlarea">
2.2 Package control information files
</A></h2>

The control information portion of a binary package is a collection of
files with names known to <kbd>dpkg</kbd>.  It will treat the contents of
these files specially - some of them contain information used by
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> when installing or removing the package; others are scripts
which the package maintainer wants <kbd>dpkg</kbd> to run.<P>

It is possible to put other files in the package control area, but
this is not generally a good idea (though they will largely be
ignored).<P>

Here is a brief list of the control info files supported by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
and a summary of what they're used for.<P>

<dl>
<dt><code>control</code><dd>This is the key description file used by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>.  It specifies the
package's name and version, gives its description for the user, states
its relationships with other packages, and so forth.
See <A href="#s-controlfile">The main control information file: <code>control</code>, section 2.3</A>.<P>

It is usually generated automatically from information in the source
package by the <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> program, and with assistance
from <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd>.  See <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#s-sourcetools">Tools for processing source packages, section 3.1</A>.
<p><dt><code>postinst</code>, <code>preinst</code>, <code>postrm</code>, <code>prerm</code><dd>These are exectuable files (usually scripts) which <kbd>dpkg</kbd> runs
during installation, upgrade and removal of packages.  They allow the
package to deal with matters which are particular to that package or
require more complicated processing than that provided by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>.
Details of when and how they are called are in
<A href="ch-maintainerscripts.html">Package maintainer scripts
and installation procedure, chapter 6</A>.<P>

It is very important to make these scripts idempotent.<A href="footnotes.html#2" name="fr2">[2]</A>  This is so that if an error occurs, the user
interrupts <kbd>dpkg</kbd> or some other unforeseen circumstance happens you
don't leave the user with a badly-broken package.<P>

The maintainer scripts are guaranteed to run with a controlling
terminal and can interact with the user.  If they need to prompt for
passwords, do full-screen interaction or something similar you should
do these things to and from <code>/dev/tty</code>, since <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will at
some point redirect scripts' standard input and output so that it can
log the installation process.  Likewise, because these scripts may be
executed with standard output redirected into a pipe for logging
purposes, Perl scripts should set unbuffered output by setting
<code>$|=1</code> so that the output is printed immediately rather than being
buffered.<P>

Each script should return a zero exit status for success, or a nonzero
one for failure.
<p><dt><code>conffiles</code><dd>This file contains a list of configuration files which are to be
handled automatically by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> (see <A href="ch-conffiles.html">Configuration file handling, chapter 9</A>).  Note
that not necessarily every configuration file should be listed here.
<p><dt><code>shlibs</code><dd>This file contains a list of the shared libraries supplied by the
package, with dependency details for each.  This is used by
<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> when it determines what dependencies are
required in a package control file. The <code>shlibs</code> file format is 
described on <A href="ch-sharedlibs.html#s-shlibs">The <code>shlibs</code> File Format, section 12.1</A>.<P>
<p></dl>

<hr>
<h2><A name="s-controlfile">
2.3 The main control information file: <code>control</code>
</A></h2>

The most important control information file used by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> when it
installs a package is <code>control</code>.  It contains all the package's
`vital statistics'.<P>

The binary package control files of packages built from Debian sources
are made by a special tool, <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd>, which reads
<code>debian/control</code> and <code>debian/changelog</code> to find the
information it needs.  See <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html">Source packages, chapter 3</A> for more details.<P>

The fields in binary package control files are:
<ul compact>
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Package"><code>Package</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-versions.html"><code>Version</code></A> (mandatory)
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Architecture"><code>Architecture</code></A>
(mandatory)<A href="footnotes.html#3" name="fr3">[3]</A>
<li><A href="ch-relationships.html"><code>Depends</code>, <code>Provides</code> et al.</A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Essential"><code>Essential</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Maintainer"><code>Maintainer</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-classification"><code>Section</code>, <code>Priority</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source"><code>Source</code></A><li><A href="ch-descriptions.html"><code>Description</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Installed-Size"><code>Installed-Size</code></A>
</ul>
<P>

A description of the syntax of control files and the purpose of these
fields is available in <A href="ch-controlfields.html">Control files and their fields, chapter 4</A>.
