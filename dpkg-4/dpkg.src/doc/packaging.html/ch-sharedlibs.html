Shared libraries
</h1>

Packages containing shared libraries must be constructed with a little
care to make sure that the shared library is always available.  This
is especially important for packages whose shared libraries are
vitally important, such as the libc.<P>

Firstly, your package should install the shared libraries under their
normal names.  For example, the <kbd>libgdbm1</kbd> package should install
<code>libgdbm.so.1.7.3</code> as <code>/usr/lib/libgdbm.so.1.7.3</code>.  The
files should not be renamed or relinked by any prerm or postrm
scripts; <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will take care of renaming things safely without
affecting running programs, and attempts to interfere with this are
likely to lead to problems.<P>

Secondly, your package should include the symlink that <kbd>ldconfig</kbd>
would create for the shared libraries.  For example, the
<kbd>libgdbm1</kbd> package should include a symlink from
<code>/usr/lib/libgdbm.so.1</code> to <code>libgdbm.so.1.7.3</code>.  This is
needed so that <kbd>ld.so</kbd> can find the library in between the time
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> installs it and <kbd>ldconfig</kbd> is run in the
<kbd>postinst</kbd> script.  Futhermore, and <em>this is very important</em>,
the library must be placed before the symlink pointing to it in the
<code>.deb</code> file.  This is so that by the time <kbd>dpkg</kbd> comes to
install the symlink (overwriting the previous symlink pointing at an
older version of the library) the new shared library is already in
place.  Currently the way to ensure the ordering is done properly is
to install the library in the appropriate <code>debian/tmp/.../lib</code>
directory before creating the symlink, by putting the commands in the
<code>debian/rules</code> in the appropriate order.<P>


Thirdly, the development package should contain a symlink for the
shared library without a version number.  For example, the
<code>libgdbm1-dev</code> package should include a symlink from
<code>/usr/lib/libgdm.so</code> to <code>libgdm.so.1.7.3</code>.  This symlink is
needed by <kbd>ld</kbd> when compiling packages as it will only look for
<code>libgdm.so</code> and <code>libgdm.a</code> when compiling dynamically or
statically, respectively.<P>

If you do the above your package does not need to call <kbd>ldconfig</kbd>
in its maintainer scripts.  It is especially important not to call
<kbd>ldconfig</kbd> in the postrm or preinst scripts in the case where the
package is being upgraded (see <A href="ch-maintainerscripts.html#s-unpackphase">Details of unpack phase of installation or upgrade, section 6.3</A>), as
<kbd>ldconfig</kbd> will see the temporary names that <kbd>dpkg</kbd> uses for the
files while it is installing them and will make the shared library
links point to them, just before <kbd>dpkg</kbd> continues the installation
and removes the links!

<h2><A name="s-shlibs">
12.1 The <code>shlibs</code> File Format
</A></h2>

This file is for use by <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> and is required when
your package provides shared libraries.<P>

Each line is of the form:
<pre><var>library-name</var> <var>version-or-soname</var> <var>dependencies ...</var></pre><P>

<var>library-name</var> is the name of the shared library, for example
<code>libc5</code>.<P>

<var>version-or-soname</var> is the soname of the library - ie, the thing
that must exactly match for the library to be recognised by
<kbd>ld.so</kbd>.  Usually this is major version number of the library.<P>

<var>dependencies</var> has the same syntax as a dependency field in a
binary package control file.  It should give details of which
package(s) are required to satisfy a binary built against the version
of the library contained in the package.  See <A href="ch-relationships.html#s-depsyntax">Syntax of relationship fields, section 8.1</A>.<P>

For example, if the package <code>foo</code> contains <code>libfoo.so.1.2.3</code>,
where the soname of the library is <code>libfoo.so.1</code>, and the first
version of the package which contained a minor number of at least
<code>2.3</code> was <var>1.2.3-1</var>, then the package's <var>shlibs</var> could
say:
<pre>libfoo 1	foo (&gt;= 1.2.3-1)</pre><P>

The version-specific dependency is to avoid warnings from <kbd>ld.so</kbd>
about using older shared libraries with newer binaries.

<h2><A name="s12.2">
12.2 Further Technical information on <code>shlibs</code>
</A></h2>
<hr>
<h3><A name="s12.2.1">
12.2.1 <em>What</em> are the <code>shlibs</code> files?
</A></h3>

The <code>debian/shlibs</code> file provides a way of checking
for shared library dependencies on packaged binaries.  They are
intended to be used by package maintainers to make their lives easier.<P>

Other <code>shlibs</code> files that exist on a Debian system are
<ul>
<li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default</code><p><li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override</code><p><li><code>/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.shlibs</code><p><li><code>debian/shlibs.local</code><p></ul>


These files are used by <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> when creating a binary
package.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s12.2.2">
12.2.2 <em>How</em> does <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> work?
</A></h3>

<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> calls <kbd>ldd</kbd> to determine the shared libraries
used by the compiled binaries passed through its command line.<P>

For each shared library, <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> needs to know 
<ul compact>
<li>the package containing the library, and<li>the library version number,</ul>
<P>
it scans the following files in this order.
<ol compact>
<li><code>debian/shlibs.local</code><li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override</code><li><code>/var/lib/dpkg/info/*.shlibs</code><li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default</code></ol>

<hr>
<h3><A name="s12.2.3">
12.2.3 <em>Who</em> maintains the various <code>shlibs</code> files?
</A></h3>

<ul compact>
<li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default</code> - the maintainer of dpkg<li><code>/var/lib/dpkg/info/</code><var>package</var><code>.shlibs</code> - the maintainer of each 
package<li><code>/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override</code> - the local system administrator<li><code>debian/shlibs.local</code> - the maintainer of the package</ul>


The <code>shlibs.default</code> file is managed by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>. The entries in
<code>shlibs.default</code> that are provided by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> are just there to
fix things until the shared library packages all have <code>shlibs</code>
files.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s12.2.4">
12.2.4 <em>How</em> to use <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> and the <code>shlibs</code> files?

</A></h3>
<hr>
<h4><A name="s12.2.4.1">
12.2.4.1 If your package doesn't provide a shared library
</A></h4>

Put a call to <kbd>dpkg-shlibs</kbd> into your <code>debian/rules</code> file.
If your package contains only binaries (e.g. no scripts) use:
<pre>dpkg-shlibdeps debian/tmp/usr/{bin,sbin}/*</pre>

If <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> doesn't complain, you're done. If it does
complain you might need to create your own <code>debian/shlibs.local</code>
file.
<hr>
<h4><A name="s12.2.4.2">
12.2.4.2 If your package provides a shared library
</A></h4>

Create a <code>debian/shlibs</code> file and let <code>debian/rules</code> install
it in the control area:

<pre>install -m644 debian/shlibs debian/tmp/DEBIAN</pre>

If your package contains additional binaries see above.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s12.2.5">
12.2.5 <em>How</em> to write <code>debian/shlibs.local</code>
</A></h3>

This file is intended only as a <em>temporary</em> fix if your binaries
depend on a library which doesn't provide its own
<code>/var/lib/dpkg/*.shlibs</code> file yet.<P>

Let's assume you are packaging a binary <code>foo</code>. Your output in
building the package might look like this.

<pre>$ ldd foo
libbar.so.1 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libbar.so.1.0
libc.so.5 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.5.2.18
libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.0</pre>

And when you ran <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd>

<pre>$ dpkg-shlibdeps -o foo
dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: unable to find dependency information 
for shared library libbar 
(soname 1, path /usr/X11R6/lib/libbar.so.1.0, dependency field Depends)
shlibs:Depends=elf-x11r6lib, libc5 (&gt;= 5.2.18)</pre>

The <kbd>foo</kbd> binary depends on the <kbd>libbar</kbd> shared library, but
no package seems to provide a <code>*.shlibs</code> file in
<code></code>var/lib/dpkg/info/.  Let's determine the package responsible:<P>

<pre>$ dpkg -S /usr/X11R6/lib/libbar.so.1.0
bar1: /usr/X11R6/lib/libbar.so.1.0
$ dpkg -s bar1 | grep Version
Version: 1.0-1</pre>

This tells us that the <kbd>bar1</kbd> package, version 1.0-1 is the one
we are using. Now we can create our own <code>debian/shlibs.local</code> to
temporarly fix the above problem. Include the following line into your
<code>debian/shlibs.local</code> file.

<pre>    libbar 1 bar1 (&gt;= 1.0-1)</pre>

Now your package build should work. As soon as the maintainer of
<kbd>libbar1</kbd> provides a <code>shlibs</code> file, you can remove your
<code>debian/shlibs.local</code> file.
