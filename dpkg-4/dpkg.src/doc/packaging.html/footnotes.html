<h1>Debian packaging manual - footnotes</h1>
<h2><A href="ch-scope.html#fr1" name="1">1</A></h2>
<P>
<kbd>dpkg</kbd>
is targetted primarily at Debian GNU/Linux, but may work on or be
ported to other systems.<h2><A href="ch-binarypkg.html#fr2" name="2">2</A></h2>
<P>
That
means that if it runs successfully or fails and then you call it again
it doesn't bomb out, but just ensures that everything is the way it
ought to be.<h2><A href="ch-binarypkg.html#fr3" name="3">3</A></h2>
<P>
This field should appear in all packages, though
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> doesn't require it yet so that old packages can still be
installed.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr4" name="4">4</A></h2>
<P>
This is so that the control file which is
produced has the right permissions<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr5" name="5">5</A></h2>
<P>
They may be specified either
in the locations in the source tree where they are created or in the
locations in the temporary build tree where they are installed prior
to binary package creation.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr6" name="6">6</A></h2>
<P>
Though there is nothing stopping an author who is
also the Debian maintainer from using it for all their changes, it
will have to be renamed if the Debian and upstream maintainers become
different people.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr7" name="7">7</A></h2>
<P>
This is generated
by the <kbd>822-date</kbd> program.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr8" name="8">8</A></h2>
<P>
<code>files.new</code> is used as a temporary file by
<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> and <kbd>dpkg-distaddfile</kbd> - they write a new
version of <code>files</code> here before renaming it, to avoid leaving a
corrupted copy if an error occurs<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr9" name="9">9</A></h2>
<P>
This is not
currently detected when building source packages, but only when
extracting them.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr10" name="10">10</A></h2>
<P>
Hard links may be permitted at
some point in the future, but would require a fair amount of
work.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr11" name="11">11</A></h2>
<P>
Setgid directories are allowed.<h2><A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#fr12" name="12">12</A></h2>
<P>
Renaming a
file is not treated specially - it is seen as the removal of the old
file (which generates a warning, but is otherwise ignored), and the
creation of the new one.<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr13" name="13">13</A></h2>
<P>
The characters <code>@</code> <code>:</code> <code>=</code> <code>%</code> <code>_</code> (at,
colon, equals, percent and underscore) used to be legal and are still
accepted when found in a package file, but may not be used in new
packages<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr14" name="14">14</A></h2>
<P>
This is a bug.<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr15" name="15">15</A></h2>
<P>
This actually invokes
<pre>gcc --print-libgcc-file-name</pre>
and parses and decomposes the output and looks the CPU type from the
GCC configuration in a table in <kbd>dpkg</kbd>.  This is so that it will
work if you're cross-compiling.<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr16" name="16">16</A></h2>
<P>
It is
usual to leave a space after the package name if a version number is
specified.<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr17" name="17">17</A></h2>
<P>
A space after each comma is conventional.<h2><A href="ch-controlfields.html#fr18" name="18">18</A></h2>
<P>
That is, the parts which are not the
<code>.dsc</code>.<h2><A href="ch-maintainerscripts.html#fr19" name="19">19</A></h2>
<P>
Part of the problem is due to what
is arguably a bug in <kbd>dpkg</kbd>.<h2><A href="ch-descriptions.html#fr20" name="20">20</A></h2>
<P>
Version 0.93.23 or
later.<h2><A href="ch-relationships.html#fr21" name="21">21</A></h2>
<P>
Current versions
(1.2.4) of <kbd>dpkg</kbd> have a bug in this area which will cause some of
these problems to be ignored.<hr>
