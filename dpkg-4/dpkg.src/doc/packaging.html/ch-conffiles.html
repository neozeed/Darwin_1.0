Configuration file handling
</h1>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> can do a certain amount of automatic handling of package
configuration files.<P>

Whether this mechanism is appropriate depends on a number of factors,
but basically there are two approaches to any particular configuration
file.<P>

The easy method is to ship a best-effort configuration in the package,
and use <kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s conffile mechanism to handle updates.  If the user
is unlikely to want to edit the file, but you need them to be able to
without losing their changes, and a new package with a changed version
of the file is only released infrequently, this is a good approach.<P>

The hard method is to build the configuration file from scratch in the
<kbd>postinst</kbd> script, and to take the responsibility for fixing any
mistakes made in earlier versions of the package automatically.  This
will be appropriate if the file is likely to need to be different on
each system.

<h2><A name="s9.1">
9.1 Automatic handling of configuration files by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
</A></h2>

A package may contain a control area file called <code>conffiles</code>.  This
file should be a list of filenames of configuration files needing
automatic handling, separated by newlines.  The filenames should be
absolute pathnames, and the files referred to should actually exist in
the package.<P>

When a package is upgraded <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will process the configuration
files during the configuration stage, shortly before it runs the
package's <kbd>postinst</kbd> script,<P>

For each file it checks to see whether the version of the file
included in the package is the same as the one that was included in
the last version of the package (the one that is being upgraded
from); it also compares the version currently installed on the system
with the one shipped with the last version.<P>

If neither the user nor the package maintainer has changed the file,
it is left alone.  If one or the other has changed their version, then
the changed version is preferred - ie, if the user edits their file,
but the package maintainer doesn't ship a different version, the
user's changes will stay, silently, but if the maintainer ships a new
version and the user hasn't edited it the new version will be
installed (with an informative message).  If both have changed their
version the user is prompted about the problem and must resolve the
differences themselves.<P>

The comparisons are done by calculating the MD5 message digests of the
files, and storing the MD5 of the file as it was included in the most
recent version of the package.<P>

When a package installs a conffile for the first time <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will
install the file that comes with it, unless that would mean
overwriting a file already on the filesystem.<P>

However, note that <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will <em>not</em> replace a conffile that
was removed by the user (or by a script).  This is necessary because
with some programs a missing file produces an effect hard or
impossible to achieve in another way, so that a missing file needs to
be kept that way if the user did it.<P>

Note that a package should <em>not</em> modify a <kbd>dpkg</kbd>-handled
conffile in its maintainer scripts.  Doing this will lead to
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> giving the user confusing and possibly dangerous options
for conffile update when the package is upgraded.

<h2><A name="s9.2">
9.2 Fully-featured maintainer script configuration handling
</A></h2>

For files which contain site-specific information such as the hostname
and networking details and so forth, it is better to create the file
in the package's <kbd>postinst</kbd> script.<P>

This will typically involve examining the state of the rest of the
system to determine values and other information, and may involve
prompting the user for some information which can't be obtained some
other way.<P>

When using this method there are a couple of important issues which
should be considered:<P>

If you discover a bug in the program which generates the configuration
file, or if the format of the file changes from one version to the
next, you will have to arrange for the postinst script to do something
sensible - usually this will mean editing the installed configuration
file to remove the problem or change the syntax.  You will have to do
this very carefully, since the user may have changed the file, perhaps
to fix the very problem that your script is trying to deal with - you
will have to detect these situations and deal with them correctly.<P>

If you do go down this route it's probably a good idea to make the
program that generates the configuration file(s) a separate program in
<code>/usr/sbin</code>, by convention called <code></code><var>package</var><code>config</code> and
then run that if appropriate from the post-installation script.  The
<code></code><var>package</var><code>config</code> program should not unquestioningly overwrite
an existing configuration - if its mode of operation is geared towards
setting up a package for the first time (rather than any arbitrary
reconfiguration later) you should have it check whether the
configuration already exists, and require a <code>--force</code> flag to
overwrite it.
