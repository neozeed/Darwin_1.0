Version numbering
</h1>

Every package has a version number, in its <code>Version</code> control file
field.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> imposes an ordering on version numbers, so that it can tell
whether packages are being up- or downgraded and so that <kbd>dselect</kbd>
can tell whether a package it finds available is newer than the one
installed on the system.  The version number format has the most
significant parts (as far as comparison is concerned) at the
beginning.<P>

The version number format is:
[<var>epoch</var><code>:</code>]<var>upstream-version</var>[<code>-</code><var>debian-revision</var>].<P>

The three components here are:

<dl>
<dt><var>epoch</var><dd>This is a single unsigned integer, which should usually be small.  It
may be omitted, in which case zero is assumed.  If it is omitted then
the <var>upstream-version</var> may not contain any colons.<P>

It is provided to allow mistakes in the version numbers of older
versions of a package, and also a package's previous version numbering
schemes, to be left behind.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will not usually display the epoch unless it is essential
(non-zero, or if the <var>upstream-version</var> contains a colon);
<kbd>dselect</kbd> does not display epochs at all in the main part of the
package selection display.
<p><dt><var>upstream-version</var><dd>This is the main part of the version.  It is usually version number of
the original (`upstream') package of which the <code>.deb</code> file has been
made, if this is applicable.  Usually this will be in the same format
as that specified by the upstream author(s); however, it may need to
be reformatted to fit into <kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s format and comparison scheme.<P>

The comparison behaviour of <kbd>dpkg</kbd> with respect to the
<var>upstream-version</var> is described below.  The <var>upstream-version</var>
portion of the version number is mandatory.<P>

The <var>upstream-version</var> may contain only alphanumerics and the
characters <code>+</code> <code>.</code> <code>-</code> <code>:</code> (full stop, plus, hyphen,
colon) and should start with a digit.  If there is no
<var>debian-revision</var> then hyphens are not allowed; if there is no
<var>epoch</var> then colons are not allowed.
<p><dt><var>debian-revision</var><dd>This part of the version represents the version of the modifications
that were made to the package to make it a Debian binary package.  It
is in the same format as the <var>upstream-version</var> and <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
compares it in the same way.<P>

It is optional; if it isn't present then the <var>upstream-version</var>
may not contain a hyphen.  This format represents the case where a
piece of software was written specifically to be turned into a Debian
binary package, and so there is only one `debianization' of it and
therefore no revision indication is required.<P>

It is conventional to restart the <var>debian-revision</var> at <code>1</code> each
time the <var>upstream-version</var> is increased.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will break the <var>upstream-version</var> and
<var>debian-revision</var> apart at the last hyphen in the string.  The
absence of a <var>debian-revision</var> compares earlier than the presence
of one (but note that the <var>debian-revision</var> is the least
significant part of the version number).<P>

The <var>debian-revision</var> may contain only alphanumerics and the
characters <code>+</code> and <code>.</code> (plus and full stop).
<p></dl>


The <var>upstream-version</var> and <var>debian-revision</var> parts are
compared by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> using the same algorithm:<P>

The strings are compared from left to right.<P>

First the initial part of each string consisting entirely of non-digit
characters is determined.  These two parts (one of which may be empty)
are compared lexically.  If a difference is found it is returned.  The
lexical comparison is a comparison of ASCII values modified so that
all the letters sort earlier than all the non-letters.<P>

Then the initial part of the remainder of each string which consists
entirely of digit characters is determined.  The numerical values of
these two parts are compared, and any difference found is returned as
the result of the comparison.  For these purposes an empty string
(which can only occur at the end of one or both version strings being
compared) counts as zero.<P>

These two steps are repeated (chopping initial non-digit strings and
initial digit strings off from the start) until a difference is found
or both strings are exhausted.<P>

Note that the purpose of epochs is to allow us to leave behind
mistakes in version numbering, and to cope with situations where the
version numbering changes.  It is <em>not</em> there to cope with version
numbers containing strings of letters which <kbd>dpkg</kbd> cannot interpret
(such as <code>ALPHA</code> or <code>pre-</code>), or with silly orderings (the author
of this manual has heard of a package whose versions went <code>1.1</code>,
<code>1.2</code>, <code>1.3</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2.1</code>, <code>2.2</code>, <code>2</code> and so forth).<P>

If an upstream package has problematic version numbers they should be
converted to a sane form for use in the <code>Version</code> field.<P>

If you need to compare version numbers ina script, you may use
<code>dpkg --compare-versions ...</code>. Type <code>dpkg --help</code> --&gt;
--for details on arguments.
