Alternative versions of an interface -
update-alternatives
</h1>

When several packages all provide different versions of the same
program or file it is useful to have the system select a default, but
to allow the system administrator to change it and have their
decisions respected.<P>

For example, there are several versions of the <kbd>vi</kbd> editor, and
there is no reason to prevent all of them from being installed at
once, each under their own name (<kbd>nvi</kbd>, <kbd>vim</kbd> or whatever).
Nevertheless it is desirable to have the name <code>vi</code> refer to
something, at least by default.<P>

If all the packages involved cooperate, this can be done with
<kbd>update-alternatives</kbd>.<P>

Each package provides its own version under its own name, and calls
<kbd>update-alternatives</kbd> in its postinst to register its version
(and again in its prerm to deregister it).<P>

See the manpage <code>update-alternatives(8)</code> for
details.<P>

If <kbd>update-alternatives</kbd> does not seem appropriate you may wish
to consider using diversions instead.
