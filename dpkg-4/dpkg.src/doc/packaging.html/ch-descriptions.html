Descriptions of packages - the
Description field
</h1>

The <code>Description</code> control file field is used by <kbd>dselect</kbd> when
the user is selecting which packages to install and by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
when it displays information about the status of packages and so
forth.  It is included on the FTP site in the <kbd>Packages</kbd> files,
and may also be used by the Debian WWW pages.<P>

The description is intended to describe the program to a user who has
never met it before so that they know whether they want to install it.
It should also give information about the significant dependencies and
conflicts between this package and others, so that the user knows why
these dependencies and conflicts have been declared.<P>

The field's format is as follows:
<pre>Description: <var>single line synopsis</var>
 <var>extended description over several lines</var></pre><P>

The synopsis is often printed in lists of packages and so forth, and
should be as informative as possible.  Every package should also have
an extended description.<P>

<h2><A name="s7.1">
7.1 Types of formatting line in the extended description
</A></h2>

<ul>
<li>Those starting with a single space are part of a paragraph.
Successive lines of this form will be word-wrapped when displayed.
The leading space will usually be stripped off.
<p><li>Those starting with two or more spaces.  These will be displayed
verbatim.  If the display cannot be panned horizontally the
displaying program will linewrap them `hard' (ie, without taking
account of word breaks).  If it can they will be allowed to trail
off to the right.  None, one or two initial spaces may be deleted,
but the number of spaces deleted from each line will be the same
(so that you can have indenting work correctly, for example).
<p><li>Those containing a single space followed by a single full stop
character.  These are rendered as blank lines.  This is the <em>only</em>
way to get a blank line - see below.
<p><li>Those containing a space, a full stop and some more characters.  These
are for future expansion.  Do not use them.<p></ul>

<h2><A name="s7.2">
7.2 Notes about writing descriptions
</A></h2>

<em>Always</em> start extended description lines with at least one
whitespace character.  Fields in the control file and in the Packages
file are separated by field names starting in the first column, just
as message header fields are in RFC822.  Forgetting the whitespace
will cause <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd><A href="footnotes.html#20" name="fr20">[20]</A> to produce a syntax error when trying to build the
package.  If you force it to build anyway <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will refuse to
install the resulting mess.<P>

<em>Do not</em> include any completely <em>empty</em> lines. These separate
different records in the Packages file and different packages in the
<code>debian/control</code> file, and are forbidden in package control
files.  See the previous paragraph for what happens if you get this
wrong.<P>

The single line synopsis should be kept brief - certainly under 80
characters.  <kbd>dselect</kbd> displays between 25 and 49 characters
without panning if you're using an 80-column terminal, depending on
what display options are in effect.<P>

Do not include the package name in the synopsis line.  The display
software knows how to display this already, and you do not need to
state it.  Remember that in many situations the user may only see
the synopsis line - make it as informative as you can.<P>

The extended description should describe what the package does and
how it relates to the rest of the system (in terms of, for
example, which subsystem it is which part of).<P>

The blurb that comes with a program in its announcements and/or
<kbd>README</kbd> files is rarely suitable for use in a description.  It
is usually aimed at people who are already in the community where the
package is used.  The description field needs to make sense to anyone,
even people who have no idea about any of the
things the package deals with.<P>

Put important information first, both in the synopis and extended
description.  Sometimes only the first part of the synopsis or of
the description will be displayed.  You can assume that there will
usually be a way to see the whole extended description.<P>

You may include information about dependencies and so forth in the
extended description, if you wish.<P>

Do not use tab characters.  Their effect is not predictable.<P>

Do not try to linewrap the summary (the part on the same line as the
field name <code>Description</code>) into the extended description.  This will
not work correctly when the full description is displayed, and makes
no sense where only the summary is available.

<h2><A name="s7.3">
7.3 Example description in control file for Smail
</A></h2>

<pre>Package: smail
Version: 3.1.29.1-13
Maintainer: Ian Jackson &lt;iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk&gt;
Recommends: pine | mailx | elm | emacs | mail-user-agent
Suggests: metamail
Depends: cron, libc5
Conflicts: sendmail
Provides: mail-transport-agent
Description: Electronic mail transport system.
 Smail is the recommended mail transport agent (MTA) for Debian.
 .
 An MTA is the innards of the mail system - it takes messages from
 user-friendly mailer programs and arranges for them to be delivered
 locally or passed on to other systems as required.
 .
 In order to make use of it you must have one or more user level
 mailreader programs such as elm, pine, mailx or Emacs (which has Rmail
 and VM as mailreaders) installed.  If you wish to send messages other
 than just to other users of your system you must also have appropriate
 networking support, in the form of IP or UUCP.</pre>
