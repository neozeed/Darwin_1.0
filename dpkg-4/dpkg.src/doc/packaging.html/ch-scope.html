Debian packaging manual - chapter 1<br>
Introduction and scope of this manual
</h1>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> is a suite of programs for creating binary package files
and installing and removing them on Unix systems.<A href="footnotes.html#1" name="fr1">[1]</A><P>

The binary packages are designed for the management of installed
executable programs (usually compiled binaries) and their associated
data, though source code examples and documentation are provided as
part of some packages.<P>

This manual describes the technical aspects of creating Debian binary
packages (<code>.deb</code> files).  It documents the behaviour of the
package management programs <kbd>dpkg</kbd>, <kbd>dselect</kbd> et al. and and the
way they interact with packages.<P>

It also documents the interaction between <kbd>dselect</kbd>'s core and the
access method scripts it uses to actually install the selected
packages, and describes how to create a new access method.<P>

This manual does not go into detail about the options and usage of the
package building and installation tools.  It should therefore be read
in conjuction with those programs' manpages.<P>

The utility programs which are provided with <kbd>dpkg</kbd> for managing
various system configuration and similar issues, such as
<kbd>update-rc.d</kbd> and <kbd>install-info</kbd>, are not described in
detail here - please see their manpages.<P>

It does <em>not</em> describe the policy requirements imposed on Debian
packages, such as the permissions on files and directories,
documentation requirements, upload procedure, and so on.  You should
see the Debian packaging policy manual for these details.  (Many of
them will probably turn out to be helpful even if you don't plan to
upload your package and make it available as part of the
distribution.)<P>

It is assumed that the reader is reasonably familiar with the
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> System Administrators' manual.  Unfortunately this manual
does not yet exist.<P>

The Debian version of the FSF's GNU hello program is provided as an
example for people wishing to create Debian packages. The Debian
<kbd>debmake</kbd> package is recommended as a very helpful tool in
creating and maintaining Debian packages. However, while the tools and
examples are helpful, they do not replace the need to read and follow
the Policy and Programmer's Manual.
