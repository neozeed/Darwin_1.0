dpkg (1.4.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed memory exhaustion errors in mlib.c to not use errno
  * fixed saving of errno in lib/ehandle.c:push_cleanup()
  * fixed incorrect assertion in dpkg-deb/main.c:sectaction()
  * the po/ directory now allows installation of .po files for multiple
    catalogs (current ones are dpkg, dpkgdeb, dpkgutil, dselect, libdpkg).
    this should make translation a bit less hairy.
  * lots of $< and $@ commands changed to explicit dependencies to work
    after a 'cd $(srcdir)'
  * debian/rules and Makefiles no longer require 'bash' instead of 'sh'.
  * more changes to dpkg-source to handle variations in 'tar' output.
  * no longer uses installed versions of dpkg to generate binary packages
    ('make binary' can (almost) be used to make packages on systems without
    dpkg).  this will probably take a few more verions to get completely
    ironed out.
  * fixed many sizeof() vs. strlen() being applied to string constants
  * tarfns.c now supports GNU-style long symbolic link names
  * Changes from Miquel van Smoorenburg:
    - fixes to update-rc.d to support new run-levels
    - fixed date on files from 2017 and 2018
    - changed start-stop-deamon message "No <program> found; none killed." to
      "No <program> found running; none killed."

dpkg (1.4.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg and utils no longer require perl to build
    (dpkg-dev and dselect still do)
  * ported to i386-apple-rhapsody5.0, powerpc-apple-rhapsody5.0
  * fixed push_cleanup() referring to function-local data
    in processarc.c
  * dpkg-source now checks patch version to determine 
    '-b' vs. '-z' options (still needs to be expanded to support
    non-GNU patch).
  * dpkg-source now handles multiple formats for 'tar' output
  * dpkg-source now handles some versions of non-GNU cpio

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 1997 15:54:35 -0500

dpkg (1.4.1.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * configurable strings now included in libdpkg.so, not compiled 
    into each binary using #defines (dpkg.h is no longer generated
    by configure; dpkg-var.c is instead).  This is a big change and
    may break some things.
  * tarfns.c now supports GNU-style long path names
    (not links, though).  
  * dpkg manual page improvements from "James R. Van Zandt" 
    <jrv@vanzandt.mv.com>.
  * Changes from Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>:
    - Corrected french translations
    - Misc build-process cleanups
    - More i18n support:
    - Marked more strings for translation
    - Allow translation of character prompts "Y/N/etc."
    - Tagged {super,sub}strings to help translators
    - Done start-stop-daemon I18n

    to avoid bash warning (Bug#10111,10131)
  * Recognize old .deb packages with other locales (Bug#12232)
  * Added `SHELL=bash' to debian/rules: it uses bash-specific structs

 -- Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Jan 2018 03:34:28 -0500

dpkg (1.4.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed methods/disk.setup to use output of
    'dpkg --print-installation-architecture' instead of hard-coded 
    '1386' (fixes #10995).
  * Patched dpkg-source to properly quote metacharacters in strings 
    before using them in pattern-matching expressions (fixes #10811).
  * Fixed several documentation typos (fixes #10764).

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jul 1997 02:37:26 -0700

dpkg (1.4.0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * dpkg-source now uses new -z option to GNU patch (still needs to be
    changed to detect and use old version as well) (fixes #9904, #10005, #10007).
  * Added i686 to archtable.
  * shlibs.default now uses xlib6 instead of elf-x11r6lib (fixes #9926).
  * debian-changelog-mode now uses interruptible completing type-in fields
    instead of the previous 'select-a-letter method'.  I consider this
    better and more standard than the previous way, but I'd welcome
    opinions to the contrary.  Consider this a 'probationary' change for
    now (fixes #9873, #9874).

 -- Klee Dienes <klee@debian.org>  Sun, 25 May 1997 09:56:08 -0400

    may be better, but it's easier to print US/Letter on A4 than it is 
    to print A4 on US/Letter).

    parsing was over) (fixes #9597, #9603, #9364).
  * Provide 50dpkg-dev.el for xemacs as well as emacs.
  * Explicitly provide path for debian-changelog-mode in 50dpkg-dev to use

  * Pass top_distdir explicitly to 'make dist' to accomodate bug in
    automake_1.1o-1.
  * Fix debian/build to make html documentation without including

  * Fix to start-stop-daemon so that it still takes numeric arguments (had
    been broken in 1.4.0.12) (fixes #9598).
  * Fix 822-date to sanity-check localtime() output (seconds must be the
    same as GMT).
  * Patch from Guy Maor <maor@ece.utexas.edu> to dpkg-source.pl to support
    pristine (MD5-equivalent) upstream sources.

    conversion (fixes #6801).
  * Renamed "programmer's manual" to 'packaging manual'.

    <tom@lpsg.demon.co.uk>.<
  * Preliminary support for dpkg functions as a shared library (now
    provides libdpkg.so, but much work needs to be done in better
    segregating and defining the interface).
  * Preliminary internationalization support by Galen Hazelwood
    <galenh@debian.org>.  Only the library, dpkg-deb, md5sum, and dpkg
    have been converted so far.  No translations have yet been
    constructed.
  * Handle 'libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x40010000)' format from libc6
    ldd (fixes #7603, #7926, #8688, #9179, #9134, #8516).

  * Changed controllib.pl to use $ENV{LOGNAME}, getlogin(), and $<
    (in that order) to determine the intended ownership of 
    debian/{files,substvars},  (fixes #7324, #6823, #5659, #5965, #5929,
    #9239, #5366).
  * Don't sign .dsc file in dpkg-buildpackage if building a binary-only
    release (fixes #7260).

    main and recursive).

  * dpkg --configure and --remove work better when `processing'
    several related packages with --no-act.

  * dpkg --auto is now two options, --pending or -a (for configure,

    once in the same run.  (Bug#1169.)

  * dpkg cosmetic fix to dependency problems message (this bug
    hasn't been triggered to my knowledge).

  * perl-dpkg no longer installed in /usr/bin.

dpkg (0.93.64) ALPHA; priority=MEDIUM

  * dpkg marks a package as no longer `to be configured in this run'
    when an error occurs, so that other packages which depend on it
    will fail (rather than causing a loop and an assertion failure,
     packages.c:166: failed assertion `dependtry <= 4').

  * dselect initial selection granularity is single-package.
  * dpkg --no-also-select option renamed to --selected-only (old option
    still accepted, but no longer in --help).  Changed -N to -O.

  * dselect `update' option changed to `install' (and other options
    renamed too).  NB: old access methods will not work, because

    messages when they skip packages.

  * dpkg --search now does a substring search if the string doesn't
    start with a wildcard character (*, [ or ?) or slash.

  * problem with C/C++ linkage of stuff in "myopt.h" fixed, to help
    with compiling with GCC 2.7.0.

    not shipped in the distribution source and will be rebuilt on the
    target system.

  * Search feature in dselect works (it was purely an ncurses bug).

  * dpkg-*.nondebbin.tar.gz now available (built by debian.rules).

  * The target directory for dpkg-deb --extract (also available as
    dpkg --extract) is no longer optional.  dpkg-deb suggests the use
    of dpkg --install if you omit it.

  * Added <errno.h> to lib/lock.c and fixed ref. to `byte' in
    md5sum/md5.c, for portability to Solaris 2.

  * Rebuilt `configure' and `config.h.in' using autoconf 2.3.
  * Revised function attribute support checking in configure script.
  * Removed obsolete `dselect.pl' from scripts directory.
  * New option --licence on all the C programs.

dpkg (0.93.38) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

  * Version number comparisons (in dpkg and dselect) now >= <=
    as documented (Bug#831; thanks to Christian Linhart).

  * dselect now has a non-superuser readonly mode.
  * dselect doesn't pop up unsatisfied `Optional's when quitting.
  * `unable to delete saved old file' message fixed dpkg_tmp to dpkg-tmp.

  * Made dpkg convert `revision' to `package_revision' when reading
    (eg) the `status' file.  libdpkg.a has `revision' as a synonym
    for `package_revision' and writes the former.

  * Major improvements and many changes to C option parsing, database
    management, error handling, Makefiles &c to support dpkg.
  * dpkg-deb should now work if sizeof(void*) < sizeof(void(*)()).

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Mon, 24 Apr 1995 12:34:39 +0100

dpkg (0.93.37) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * Fixed segfault if no description available (Bug#735);
    thanks to Peter Tobias for the bug report.
  * Fixed other assorted minor bugs in description displays.

  * Changed dpkg-deb --info short option from -i to -I, to make
    it unique across dpkg and dpkg-deb (-i still works with
    dpkg-deb for backwards compatibility).

  * Produce more sensible error when main package list is empty.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Fri, 7 Apr 1995 02:24:55 +0100

dpkg (0.93.36) BETA; priority=LOW (MEDIUM for dselect users)

  * All the C code (including dselect) updated to support `provides'
    (virtual packages).
  * Revamped dselect's related package selection/deselection
    algorithms.
  * Everything can now handle arbitrary `class' values (as well
    as the predefined ones which we understand and can interpret).
  * Fixed bug that prevented display update when moving down a small
    recursive package list in dselect.
  * Column heading characters corrected from `SHOC' to `HSOC'.

 -- Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>  Thu, 6 Apr 1995 12:48:13 +0100

dpkg (0.93.35) BETA; priority=MEDIUM

 * Preserve ownerships and permissions on configuration files.
 * Fix bug in conffile updating that could leave a hardlink
   <foo>.dpkg-new to the conffile <foo>.

 * Improved dselect's package list help messages.
 * Highlight now moves on after (de)selecting just one package.
 * Better algorithm for scrolling up/down when moving highlight.
 * Fixed bug in display of `preformatted' extended Description lines.
   (dselect is still ALPHA, but is fairly stable.)

 * Improved dpkg's message when configuring a package that doesn't
   exist, and when selecting or skipping a package that isn't
   currently selected (during unpack processing).

 * Description in control file expanded.

 * Scroll back to top when changing what is in the `info' area.

dpkg (0.93.34) BETA; priority=LOW (HIGH for dselect users)

 * dselect: Fixed bug which caused a coredump if you exited the
   package list if you'd made any changes.  Ouch !

 * dselect: Improved selection algorithm to show fewer extraneous
   packages; improved display for unavailable packages.

 * dpkg: Improved progress messages during unpacking somewhat.

dpkg (0.93.33) BETA; priority=LOW (HIGH for dselect users)

 * dselect now has a main menu.

 * Fixed nasty uninitialised data bug in dselect.

 * dselect now locks and unlocks the packages database.

Mon, 27 Mar 1995 03:30:51 BST  Ian Jackson <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg (0.93.32): Alpha dselect released and installed in
	                  /usr/sbin/dselect.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): Many portability enhancements: should now
	                  compile using GCC 2.6.3, and dpkg-deb should
	                  compile better on non-Linux systems.

	                  just for input buffers.
	* dpkg (0.93.32): varbuf has C++ member functions in header
	                  #ifdef __cplusplus.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.31:

* start-stop-daemon --pidfile now works (Bug#571).
* Fixed dependency processing bugs which could require a rerun of
  dpkg --configure (Bug#566).
* Fixed garbage output for `language' of control file in dpkg-deb --info.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.29:

* Made postinst scripts really be run when dpkg --purge used.
* Added new --force-extractfail option - VERY DANGEROUS.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.28:

* Make version number specifications in Depends &c work.
* Added AC_PROG_CXX to autoconf.in for dselect.
* Changed myopt.h not to have cipaction field in cmdinfo (this was
  specially for dpkg-deb) - now we have a generic void*.
* Renamed `class' member of `pkginfoperfile' to `clas' [sic].
* Much work in `dselect' subdirectory.
* Deleted executables, objects and libraries from OLD tree !
* Minor changes to various copyright notices and top-of-file comments.
* Don't install nasty Perl dselectish thing as /usr/bin/dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.26:

* Added --no-also-select instead of not auto-selecting on --unpack
  but doing so on --install; removed --force-unpack-any.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.25:

* Fixed duplicate output (failure to flush before fork) bug.
* More clarification of md5sum.c copyright.
* Corrected typo in ChangeLog in 0.93.24 source package.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.24:

* dpkg could copy conffiles info from one package to another.  Aargh.
  Bug #426.
* dpkg failed to initialise status if you tried to remove or
  configure a nonexistent package.  Bug #419.
* install-info now handles START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY entries like:
   * Gdb::                         The GNU debugger.
  Previously it would only accept (Bug #407):
   * Gdb: (gdb).                   The GNU debugger.
* When installing a new foo.info[.gz], install-info now replaces
   * Foo: (foo.info).              The Gnoo Foo.
  as well as just * Foo: (foo). ...
* Moved option parsing out of dpkg-deb into libdpkg.
* Assorted minor source code rearrangements.
* Fixed assorted copyright notices, clarified md5sum copyright.
* Corrected typo in 0.93.23 source package's ChangeLog.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.23:

* `dpkg-deb' --build now does a syntax check on the control file.
* `dselect' is now no longer called `debian', spurious copy removed
  from package top-level source directory.
* C control information parsing complete and somewhat tested.
* Moved `global' include files into $(srcdir)/include from ../lib,
  added some files to the lib Makefile, and arranged for pop_cleanup().

Changes in dpkg 0.93.22:

* Fixed bug which caused dpkg to see failures of md5sum where there
  were none (would also have caused dpkg to miss a real failure).
* Fixed failure to update some `status' database fields.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.21:

* Fixed error-handling bug which could corrupt database.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.20:

* Fixed bug which ran old (/var/adm/dpkg) postinst scripts.
* Fixed dpkg usage message which claimed -i => both --install & --info.
* Use Colin Plumb's MD5 code - faster, and better copyright.
* Manpages: dpkg-deb(8), deb-control(5), deb(5) - thanks to Raul
  Deluth Miller.  Also, an xfig picture of some C program innards.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.19:

* Don't delete the `list' file from the dpkg database.
* Fixed various bugs in the conffile handling.
* Conffiles that are symlinks will now be treated as if the
  `dereferenced' name of the file was listed in conffiles.  This means
  that /etc/foo -> /usr/etc/foo will cause all conffile updates of
  /etc/foo to create /usr/etc/foo.dpkg-tmp &c instead.  However, the
  link will be removed if --purge is used to delete all the conffiles.
* When doing a new installation, or when updating a conffile that
  wasn't listed as a conffile in the old version of the package, don't
  do any prompting but just install the version from the archive.
* Corrected error message if exec of dpkg --vextract failed
  and --instroot or --root specified.
* Added new --force-unpack-any option.
* Extra newline after --status output.
* Added -W options to CFLAGS.
* Fixed mistake in previous ChangeLog entry.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.18:

* Fixed invocation of dpkg-deb --vextract if --root or --instdir
  not specified.
* Create /var/lib/dpkg/updates.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.17:

* install-info --remove exits with status 0 if it doesn't find the
  thing to remove, instead of status 1.
* Error handling functions have __attribute__((format...)) if GCC.
* push_cleanup its arg takes void **argv instead of char **argv.
* Top-level Makefile.in has set -e before `for' loops.
* dpkg-deb --info not-an-existing-file produces fewer error messages.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.16:

* Made --root= option really extract to $instroot instead of `/'.
* install-info clears the 0444 bits in its umask.
* Fixed a few database handling bugs which cause dpkg always to fail,
  and usually to corrupt the status database in various ways.
* dpkg-deb completely rewritten, now doesn't tinker with
  /var/{adm,lib}/dpkg.  Should be faster.
* Directory structure and Makefiles in source package reorganised.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.15:

* Added `debian' (dselect), still very primitive.
* Database format changed, and moved from /var/adm to /var/lib.
* Added dpkg --avail mode, --list, --status and --search.
* Set of dpkg => dpkg-deb pass-through operations changed (but
  dpkg-deb not yet updated).
* Added --root, --admindir and --instdir, as well as --isok &c.
* Moved much stuff into /usr/lib/dpkg-lib.pl, rewritten status
  database handling.
* Put packages in `purge' state even if `deinstall' requested if
  they have no postrm and no conffiles.
* Version number comparisons fixed.
* insert-version.pl now installes lib.pl filename too.
* Strip trailing slashes when reading files from file lists.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.14:

* Fixed parsing of DEPENDS &c fields with trailing whitespace.
* postinst now fixes up broken ispell.control file.
* Cyclic dependency/multiple package removal processing: don't consider
  packages we've just removed when looking for a reason not to go ahead.
* Added call to postinst with `purge' argument for expunging old
  configuration etc. that aren't listed in conffiles.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.13:

* sub S_ISREG defined in dpkg.pl.
* Checking of DEPENDS &c fields was too lax, causing an internal error
  if you fed it certain kinds of broken control file.
* Fixed misleading message from bogus installationstatus call.
* New -u and -U options to dpkg-deb which don't unpack the /DEBIAN
  directory, and use these in dpkg.pl; clean up /DEBIAN in postinst.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.12:

* No longer needs *.ph files, since these appear to be broken.
* Postinst fixes up *.control files with curly brackets.
* embryo of dselect.

Changes in dpkg 0.93.11:

* New --ignore-depends option.
* This ChangeLog changed format here.

Wed Nov 30 15:38:21 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

	* dpkg 0.93.11 released.

	* conffile updating fixed.

	* Message `updgrade' in dpkg changed to `replace'.

	* install-info now copes with multi-line entries.

	* version numbers now done automatically in dpkg and install-info.

	* more debugging around conffiles updates.

	* *.hash files not deleted so soon.

	* adds brand new packages to status array so we can install them.

	* postinst does h2ph for {sys,linux}/{stat,types}.ph if required.

Mon Nov 28 02:00:13 GMT 1994  Ian Jackson  <iwj10@cus.cam.ac.uk>

        * dpkg 0.93.10 released.

        * dpkg.pl completely rewritten.

        * dpkg-deb: removed dabase-processing and --install option.

        * Makefiles reworked, debian.rules added.

        * Don't install anything in /usr/doc/examples.

        * dpkg-*.deb contains /usr/bin/dpkg-deb.dist, fixed up by postinst.

Thu Oct 20 13:22:20 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.9 released.

        * dpkg.pl: Use $argument, not $package, with `--build'.
        Make sure that saved postinst scripts are executable.

Tue Oct 18 09:40:57 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.8 released.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Do not report an error from rmdir ()
        when `errno' is ENOTEMPTY (Directory not empty), because in this
        case we have found the highest-level directory in the package and
        are ready to exit the loop (i.e., it is a normal occurrence).

Mon Oct 17 10:44:32 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in: Adapted all Makefiles to the GNU Coding Standards.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Make sure that parent directories are
        removed LAST!  This will result in complete removal of packages
        when --remove is called.  dpkg 0.93.7 (and earlier) had problems
        with this because it tried to remove directories in order, which
        will work most of the time, but not necessarily all of the time.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): Output is sorted by package name.

Tue Oct  4 12:27:10 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): When a list file cannot be
        opened, silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): When a control file cannot be opened,
        silently fail and let the front-end explain the problem.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Exit 0 if the regular expression is
        matched and 1 if it is not.

Mon Oct  3 18:38:53 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg.pl: New file.  Replaces dpkg.sh.

        * deb/Makefile.in: Renamed `dpkg-util.deb' to `dpkg-deb'.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): `--build' is less verbose, instead
        letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): Ditto.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): Ditto.

        * deb/search.c (pkg_search): Ditto.

        * deb/describe.c (pkg_describe): `--describe' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Description:'' label has been removed.

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' is less verbose,
        instead letting the front-end add verbosity where appropriate.
        The ``Version:'' label has been removed, as has the maintainer
        information.

Mon Sep 12 14:22:04 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): `--version' now reports the
        version number of dpkg if no argument is specified.

Thu Sep  1 13:31:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.7 released.

        * deb/build.c (pkg_build): check status and exit if non-zero.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): ditto.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): ditto.

Thu Sep  1 13:20:08 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * deb/version.c (pkg_version): indent to the same point as
        pkg_describe.

Thu Sep  1 12:21:11 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * Makefile.in (dist): added debian.rules binary, source and
        dist targets to make final distribution easier to make.
        (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/Makefile.in (install): install programs to /usr/bin.

        * deb/list.c (pkg_list): enforce a maximum limit of ten characters
        for the package name in the output.
        (pkg_list): left-justify the version number to make it easier for
        the front-end to parse the output.
        (pkg_list): replace first '\n' character in packages[n].description
        with '\0'.

        * deb/install.c (archive_extract): use the `p' option to `tar' to
        ensure that permissions are preserved.

Sat Aug 27 09:53:37 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.6 released.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): only unlink CONTROL if ARCHIVE_FLAG is
        true!

Fri Aug 26 15:38:22 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * dpkg 0.93.5 released.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): merged function archive_contents
        into function pkg_contents.

        * deb/contents.c (pkg_contents): use lstat (rather than stat) so
        that symbolic links are recognized.
        (pkg_contents): print the usual `<path> -> <link_to>' now that we
        recognize symbolic links.

        * deb/util.c (return_info): create a FIFO to pipe the needed
        information to the ``formatter'' rather than creating a directory
        in /tmp for the package information, which is what we used to do.

Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994  Ian Murdock  (imurdock@debra.debian.org)

        * lib/fake-ls.c (mk_date_string): return a pointer to malloc'ed
        area.
        (mk_mode_string): ditto.

        * dpkg.sh: make sure the control information is extracted to a
        uniquely-named temporary directory during package installation.

        * dpkg.sh: execute the pre- and post-removal scripts during
        package removal.

        * dpkg.sh: exit immediately if dpkg-util.deb reports failure.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_control): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_extract): make sure that `package' exists and
        is a Debian archive before doing anything.

        * deb/install.c (pkg_install): unlink `extract_output' when done.

        * deb/remove.c (pkg_remove): use lstat (rather than stat) so that
        --remove does not get confused and think that a symbolic link to a
        directory is actually a directory, which results in the symbolic
        link never being removed at all.

ChangeLog begins Thu Aug 25 11:46:27 1994 for dpkg 0.93.5.
