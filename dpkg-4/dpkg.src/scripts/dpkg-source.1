.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dpkg-source
packs and unpacks Debian source archives.

.B dpkg-gencontrol
reads information from an unpacked Debian source tree and generates a
binary package control file on standard output; it also adds an entry
for the binary package to
.BR debian/files .

.B dpkg-shlibdeps
calculates shared library dependencies for executables named in its
arguments.  The dependencies are added to the substitution
variables file
.B debian/substvars
as variable names
.BI shlibs: dependencyfield
where
.I dependencyfield
is a dependency field name.  Any other variables starting
.I shlibs:
are removed from the file.
.B dpkg-shlibdeps
will read shared library dependency information from
.BR debian/shlibs.local ,
.BR /etc/dpkg/shlibs.override ,
the
.B shlibs
control area file of the package containing the file which
.B ldd
reports as satisfying the library dependency, or
.BR /etc/dpkg/shlibs.default .
The first match will be used.  See the
.I Debian packaging manual
for details of the format of shared library dependency files.

.B dpkg-genchanges
reads information from an unpacked and built Debian source tree and
from the files it has generated and generates a Debian upload control
file
.RB ( .changes " file)."

.B dpkg-buildpackage
is a control script which can be used to help automate the building of
a package.

.B dpkg-distaddfile
adds an entry for a named file to
.BR debian/files .

.B dpkg-parsechangelog
reads and parses the changelog of an unpacked Debian source tree and
outputs the information in it to standard output in a machine-readable
form.

None of these commands allow multiple options to be combined into one,
and they do not allow the value for an option to be specified in a
separate argument.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
Many of these programs share options; these are described here,
together with the programs that accept them.
.TP
.BI -h
Display the particular program's version and usage message, including
a synopsis of the options it understands.  This option is understood
by all the source package tools.
.TP
.BI -v version
In
.BR dpkg-buildpackage ", " dpkg-genchanges " and " dpkg-parsechangelog
this causes changelog information from all versions strictly later
than
.I version
(which must appear in the changelog file) to be used.

In
.BR dpkg-gencontrol
it sets the version number of the binary package which will be
generated.
.TP
.BI -C changesdescription
Read the description of the changes from the file
.I changesdescription
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog
file.  This is understood by
.BR dpkg-buildpackage " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BI -m maintaineraddress
Use
.I maintaineraddress
as the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload,
rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog.
This is understood by
.BR dpkg-buildpackage " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BR -si ", " -sa ", " -sd
These options control whether the original source archive is included
in the upload generated by
.BR dpkg-buildpackage " and " dpkg-genchanges
if any source is being generated (ie,
.BR -b " or " -B
haven't been used).

By default, or if
.B -si
is specified, the original source will be included if the version
number ends in
.BR -0 " or " -1 ,
ie if the Debian revision part of the version number is
.BR 0 " or " 1 .

.B -sa
forces the inclusion of the original source;
.B -sd
forces its exclusion and includes only the diff.
.TP
.BI -V name = value
Set an output substitution variable.
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
See below for a discussion of output substitution.
.TP
.BI -T substvarsfile
Read (or, for
.BR dpkg-shlibdeps ,
write) substitution variables in
.IR substvarsfile ;
the default is
.BR debian/substvars .
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol ", " dpkg-shlibdeps " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BI -D field = value
Override or add an output control file field.
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BI -U field
Remove an output control file field.
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BR -b | -B
For
.BR dpkg-genchanges " and " dpkg-buildpackage
this specifies that a binary-only build is taking place.
.B -b
indicates that no source files are to be built and/or distributed, and
.B -B
that no architecture-independent binary package files are to be
distributed either.  The distinction between
.BR -b " and " -B
is only used by
.BR dpkg-buildpackage ;
.B dpkg-genchanges
just produces a
.B .changes
file for whatever files were produced by the
.B binary-*
target(s) of the package being built.

.B -b
tells
.B dpkg-source
to build a source package (rather than to extract one) - see below.
.TP
.BI -c controlfile
Specifies the main source control file to read information from.  The
default is
.BR debian/control .
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BI -l changelogfile
Specifies the change log file to read information from.  The
default is
.BR debian/changelog .
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.TP
.BI -f fileslistfile
Read or write the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using
.BR debian/files .
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-gencontrol ", " dpkg-genchanges " and " dpkg-distaddfile .
.TP
.BI -F changelogformat
Specifies the format of the changelog.  By default the format is read
from a special line near the bottom of the changelog (see the
Debian packaging manual) or failing that defaults to
.BR debian ,
the standard format described in the
.IR "Debian packaging manual" .
This option is understood by
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges .
.SH DPKG-SOURCE OPTIONS
When the common options
.BR -c " and " -l
are given with relative pathnames these are interpreted starting at
the source tree's top level directory.
.TP
.B -x
Extract a source package.  One non-option argument should be supplied,
the name of the Debian source control file
.RB ( .dsc ).
No options are useful with
.BR "dpkg-source -x" .
.B dpkg-source
will read the names of the other file(s) making up the source package
from the control file; they are assumed to be in the same directory as
the
.BR .dsc .

The files in the extracted package will have their permissions and
ownerships set to those which would have been expected if the files
and directories had simply been created - directories and executable
files will be 0777 and plain files will be 0666, both modified by the
extractors' umask; if the parent directory is setgid then the
extracted directories will be too, and all the files and directories
will inherit its group ownership.
.TP
.B -b
Build: pack up a source tree.  One or two non-option arguments should
be supplied.  The first is taken as the name of the directory
containing the unpacked source tree.  If a second argument is supplied
it should be the name of the original source directory or tarfile or
the empty string if the package is a Debian-specific one and so has no
Debianisation diffs.  If no second argument is supplied then
.B dpkg-source
will look for the original source tarfile
.IB package _ upstream-version .orig.tar.gz
or the original source directory
.IB directory .orig
or the empty string (no original source, and so no diff) depending on
the arguments.
.TP
.BR -sa , -sp , -su , -sk , -sA , -sP , -sU , -sK , -ss " with " -b
If
.BR -sk " or " -sp
is specified
.B dpkg-source
expects the original source as a tarfile, by default
.IB package _ upstream-version .orig.tar.gz\fR.
It will leave this original source in place as a tarfile, or copy it
to the current directory if it isn't already there
If
.B -sp
is used rather than
.B -sk
it will remove it again afterwards.

If
.BR -su " or " -sr
is specified the original source is expected as a directory, by
default
.IB package - upstream-version .orig
and
.B dpkg-source
will create a new original source archive from it.  If
.B -sr
is used
.B dpkg-source will remove that directory after it has been used.

If
.B -ss
is specified
.B dpkg-source
will expect that the original source is available both as a directory
and as a tarfile.  If will use the directory to create the diff, but
the tarfile to create the
.BR .dsc .
This option must be used with care - if the directory and tarfile do
not match a bad source archive will be generated.

If
.B -sn
is specified
.B dpkg-source
will not look for any original source, and will not generate a diff.
The second argument, if supplied, must be the empty string.  This is
used for Debian-specific packages which do not have a separate
upstream source and therefore have no debianisation diffs.

If
.BR -sa " or " -sA
is specified
.B dpkg-source
will look for the original source archive as a tarfile or as a
directory - the second argument, if any, may be either, or the empty
string (this is equivalent to using
.BR -sn ).
If a tarfile is found it will unpack it to create the diff and remove
it afterwards (this is equivalent to
.BR -sp );
if a directory is found it will pack it to create the original source
and remove it afterwards (this is equivalent to
.BR -sr );
if neither is found it will assume that the package has no
debianisation diffs, only a straightforward source archive (this is
equivalent to
.BR -sn ).
If both are found then dpkg-source will ignore the directory,
overwriting it, if
.B -sA
was specified (this is equivalent to
.BR -sP )
or raise an error if
.B -sa
was specified.
.B -sA
is the default.

.BR -sa ", " -sp ", " -sk ", " -su " and "  -sr
will not overwrite existing tarfiles or directories.  If this is
desired then
.BR -sA ", " -sP ", " -sK ", " -su " and "  -sR
should be used instead.
.TP
.BR -sp , -su , -sn " with " -x
In all cases any existing original source tree will be removed.

If
.B -sp
is used when extracting then the original source (if any) will be left
as a tarfile.  If it is not already located in the current directory
or if an existing but different file is there it will be copied there.
This is the default.

.B -su
unpacks the original source tree.

.B -sn
ensures that the original source is neither copied to the current
directory nor unpacked.  Any original source tree that was in the
current directory is still removed.
.SH DPKG-GENCONTROL OPTIONS
.B dpkg-gencontrol
does not take any non-option arguments.
.TP
.BI -p package
Generate information for the binary package
.IR package .
If the source control file lists several binary packages then this
option may be omitted; otherwise it is essential to select which
binary package's information to generate.
.TP
.BR -is ", " -ip ", " -isp
Include the
.BR Section " and " Priority
fields for this package from the main source control file in the
binary package control file being generated.  Usually this information
is not included here, but only in the
.B .changes
file.
.B -isp
includes both fields,
.BR -is " only the " Section " and " -ip " only the " Priority .
.TP
.BI -P packagebuilddir
Tells
.B dpkg-source
that the package is being built in
.I packagebuilddir
instead of
.BR debian/tmp .
This value is used to find the default value of the
.B Installed-Size
substitution variable and control file field (using
.BR du ),
and for the default location of the output file.
.TP
.B -O
Causes the control file to be printed to standard output, rather than
to
.B debian/tmp/DEBIAN/control
(or
.IB packagebuilddir /DEBIAN/control
if
.B -P
was used).
.SH DPKG-SHLIBDEPS OPTIONS
.B dpkg-shlibdeps
interprets non-option arguments as executable names, just as if they'd
been supplied as
.BI -e executable\fR.
.TP
.BI -e executable
Include dependencies appropriate for the shared libraries required by
.IR executable .
.TP
.BI -d dependencyfield
Add dependencies to be added to the control file dependency field
.IR dependencyfield .
(The dependencies for this field are placed in the variable
.BI shlibs: dependencyfield\fR.)

The
.BI -d dependencyfield
option takes effect for all executables after the option, until the
next
.BI -d dependencyfield\fR.
The default
.I dependencyfield
is
.BR Depends .

If the same dependency entry (or set of alternatives) appears in more
than one of the recognised dependency field names
.BR Pre-Depends ", " Depends ", " Recommends " or " Suggests
then
.B dpkg-shlibdeps
will automatically remove the dependency from all fields except the
one representing the most important dependencies.
.TP
.BI -p varnameprefix
Causes substitution variables to start with
.IB varnameprefix :
instead of
.BR shlib: .
Likewise, any existing substitution variables starting with
.IB varnameprefix :
(rather than
.BR shlib: )
are removed from the the substitution variables file.
.TP
.BI -L localshlibsfile
Causes
.B dpkg-shlibs
to read overriding shared library dependency information from
.I localshlibsfile
instead of
.BR debian/shlibs.local .
.TP
.B -O
Causes the substitution variable settings to be printed to standard
output, rather than being added to the substitution variables file
.RB ( debian/substvars
by default).
.SH DPKG-GENCHANGES OPTIONS
.B dpkg-gencontrol
does not take any non-option arguments.
.TP
.BI -u uploadfilesdir
Look for the files to be uploaded in
.I uploadfilesdir
rather than
.B ..
.RB ( dpkg-genchanges
needs to find these files so that it can include their sizes and
checksums in the
.B .changes
file).
.TP
.B -q
Usually
.B dpkg-genchanges
will produce informative messages on standard error, for example about
how many of the package's source files are being uploaded.
.B -q
suppresses these messages.
.SH DPKG-BUILDPACKAGE OPTIONS
.B dpkg-buildpackage
does not take any non-option arguments.
.TP
.BI -r gain-root-command
When
.B dpkg-buildpackage
needs to execute part of the build process as root, it prefixes the
command it executes with
.I gain-root-command
if one has been specified.
.I gain-root-command
should be the name of a program on the
.B PATH
and will get as arguments the name of the real command to run and the
arguments it should take.
.I gain-root-command
should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.
.\" what happens, if it contains spaces? (hs)
.I gain-root-command
might typically be
.BR sudo ", " super " or " really .
.B su
is not suitable, since it requires a
.B -c
option to run a command and even then it can only invoke the user's
shell with
.B -c
instead of passing arguments individually to the command to be run.
.TP
.BI -p pgp-command
When
.B dpkg-buildpackage
needs to execute PGP to sign a source control
.RB ( .dsc )
file or a
.B .changes
file it will run
.I pgp-command
(searching the
.B PATH
if necessary) instead of
.BR pgp .
.I pgp-command
will get all the arguments that
.B pgp
would have done.
.I pgp-command
should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.
.TP
.B -tc
Clean the source tree (using
.I gain-root-command
.BR "debian/rules clean" )
after the package has been built.
.TP
.BR -us ", " -uc
Do not PGP-sign the source package or the changelog, respectively.
.SH DPKG-DISTADDFILE ARGUMENTS
.B dpkg-distaddfile
does not take any non-common options.  It takes three non-option
arguments, the filename and the section and priority for the
.B .changes
file.

The filename should be specified relative to the directory where
.B dpkg-genchanges
will expect to find the files, usually
.BR .. ,
rather than being a pathname relative to the current directory when
.B dpkg-distaddfile
is run.
.SH DPKG-PARSECHANGELOG ARGUMENTS
.B dpkg-parsechangelog
does not take any non-common options or non-option arguments.
.SH VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION
Before
.BR dpkg-source ", " dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges
write their control information (to the source control file
.B .dsc
for
.B dpkg-source
and to standard output for
.BR dpkg-gencontrol " and " dpkg-genchanges )
they perform some variable substitutions on the output file.

A variable substitution has the form
.BI ${ variable-name }\fR.
Variable names consist of alphanumerics, hyphens and colons and start
with an alphanumeric.  Variable substitutions are performed repeatedly
until none are left; the full text of the field after the substitution
is rescanned to look for more substitutions.

After all the substitutions have been done each occurence of the
string
.B ${}
(which is not a legal substitution) is replaced with a
.B $
sign.

Variables can be set using the
.B -V
common option.  They can be also specified in the file
.B debian/substvars
(or whatever other file is specified using the
.B -T
option).  This file consists of lines of the form
.IB name = value\fR.
Trailing whitespace on each line, blank lines, and
lines starting with a
.B #
symbol (comments) are ignored.

Additionally, the following standard variables are available:
.TP
.BI Arch
The current build architecture (from
.BR "dpkg \-\-print-architecture" ).
.TP
.B Source-Version
The source package version (from the changelog file).
.TP
.B Installed-Size
The total size of the package's installed files.  This value is copied
into the corresponding control file field; setting it will modify the
value of that field.  If this variable isn't set
.B dpkg-gencontrol
will use
.B du -k debian/tmp
to find the default value.
.TP
.B Extra-Size
Additional disk space used when the package is installed.  If this
variable is set its value is added to that of the
.B Installed-Size
variable (whether set explicitly or using the default value) before it
is copied into the
.B Installed-Size
control file field.
.TP
.BI F: fieldname
The value of the output field
.IR fieldname
(which must be given in the canonical capitalisation).  Setting these
variables has no effect other than on places where they are expanded
explicitly.
.TP
.B Format
The
.B .changes
file format version generated by this version of the source packaging
scripts.  If you set this variable the contents of the
.B Format
field in the
.B .changes
file will change too.
.TP
.BR Newline ", " Space ", " Tab
These variables each hold the corresponding character.
.TP
.BI shlibs: dependencyfield
Variable settings with names of this form are generated by
.B dpkg-shlibdeps
- see above.
.LP
If a variable is referred to but not defined it generates a warning
and an empty value is assumed.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B debian/control
The main source control information file, giving version-independent
information about the source package and the binary packages it can
produce.
.TP
.B debian/changelog
The changelog file, used to obtain version-dependent information about
the source package, such as the urgency and distribution of an upload,
the changes made since a particular release, and the source version
number itself.
.TP
.B debian/files
The list of generated files which are part of the upload being
prepared.
.B dpkg-gencontrol
adds the presumed filenames of binary packages whose control files it
generates here;
.B dpkg-distaddfile
can be used to add additional files.
.B dpkg-genchanges
reads the data here when producing a
.B .changes
file.
.TP
.B debian/substvars
List of substitution variables and values.
.TP
.B debian/shlibs.local
Package-local overriding shared library dependency information.
.TP
.B /etc/dpkg/shlibs.override
Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
.TP
.B /etc/dpkg/shlibs.default
Per-system default shared library dependency information.
.SH BUGS
The point at which field overriding occurs compared to certain
standard output field settings is rather confused.

The binary package entries in the 
.B debian/files
file will be passed through variable substitution twice.  This should
not matter, since
.BR $ ", " { " and " }
are not legal in package names or version numbers.

It should be possible to specify spaces and shell metacharacters in
and initial arguments for
.IR gain-root-command " and " pgp-command .
