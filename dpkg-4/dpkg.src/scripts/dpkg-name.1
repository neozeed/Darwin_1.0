.TH dpkg-name 1 "May 1996" "Debian Project" "Debian Linux"
.SH NAME
dpkg\-name \- rename Debian packages to full package names
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dpkg\-name 
[\-a|\-\-no\-architecture] [\-o|\-\-overwrite] [\-s|\-\-subdir [dir]]
[\-c|\-\-create\-dir] [\-h|\-\-help] [\-v|\-\-version]
[\-l|\-\-license] [\-[--] [files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page documents the
.B dpkg\-name 
sh script which provides an easy way to rename
.B Debian
packages into their full package names. A full package name consists
of <package>_<version>_<architecture>.deb as specified in the control
file of the package. The <version> part of the filename consists of
the mainstream version information optionally followed by a hyphen and
the revision information.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B dpkg-name bar-foo.deb
The file `bar-foo.deb' will be renamed to bar-foo_1.0-2_i386.deb or
something similar (depending on whatever information is in the control
part of `bar-foo.deb').
.TP
.B find /root/debian/ \-name '*.deb' | xargs \-n 1 dpkg\-name \-a
All files with the extension `deb' in the directory /root/debian and its
subdirectory's will be renamed by dpkg\-name if required into names with no
architecture information.
.TP
.B find -name '*.deb' | xargs \-n 1 dpkg-name -a -o -s -c
.B Don't do this.
Your archive will be messed up completely because a lot of packages
don't come with section information.
.B Don't do this.
.TP
.B dpkg --build debian-tmp && dpkg-name -o -s .. debian-tmp.deb
This can be used when building new packages.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-a, \-\-no\-architecture"
The destination filename will not have the architecture information. 
.TP 
.B "\-o, \-\-overwrite"
Existing files will be overwritten if they have the same name as the
destination filename.
.TP 
.B "\-s, \-\-subdir [dir]"
Files will be moved into subdir. If directory given as argument exists
the files will be moved into that direcotory otherswise the name of
the target directory is extracted from the section field in the
control part of the package. The target directory will be
`unstable/binary-<architecture>/<section>'. If the section is
`non-free', `contrib' or no section information is found in the
control file the target directory is
`<section>/binary-<architecture>'. The section field isn't required so
a lot of packages will find their way to the `no-section' area. Use
this option with care, it's messy.
.TP
.B "\-c, \-\-create\-dir"
This option can used together with the \-s option. If a target
directory isn't found it will be created automatically. 
.B Use this option with care.
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Print a usage message and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-v, \-\-version"
Print version information and exit successfully.
.TP
.B "\-l, \-\-license"
Print copyright information and (a reference to GNU) license
information and exit successfully.
.SH BUGS?
Successfully tested on
.B Debian Linux 
systems only. Some packages don't follow the name structure
<package>_<version>_<architecture>.deb. Packages renamed by dpkg-name
will follow this structure. Generally this will have no impact on how
packages are installed by dselect/dpkg, but other installation tools
might depend on this naming structure.
