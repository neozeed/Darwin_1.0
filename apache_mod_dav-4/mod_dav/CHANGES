    database (from Keith Wannamaker)
  * fixed a case where the lock database wasn't closed (Joe Orton)
  * add interoperability code for Netscape's Roaming Profiles
    (untested; based on example patch from Niels Baggesen)

Version 0.9.14-1.3.6 (released 17-Dec-1999)

  * make the configure process a bit more robust for --with-apache
  * major fixes to locking behavior:
    - locknull resources behave better
    - refreshing works better
    - PUT, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY inherit locks appropriately
    - some fixes to UNLOCK behavior
    - lots of work on the validation: the If: header is now processed
      properly, and LOCK will look for conflicting locks
    - tagged URIs in an If: header now match properly
  * more changes to locking provider API
  * bug #37: locknull files were accidentally labelled as collections
  * PROPPATCH now has full rollback behavior in case of an error
  * PROPPATCH/remove no longer errors if a property is not present
  * DAVMinTimeout is now allowed at the top level, per the documentation
  * some fixes to the .dsp file: link against Apache's Expat, use MT DLLs
  * add new utility for managing locks (from client side): lock.py

Version 0.9.13-1.3.6 (released 19-Nov-1999)

  * revise internal error handling: cleaner, simpler, more info, etc.
    For more detail, review the CVS logs for "dav_error" changes.
  * using the above changes, put more info into the error log and in
    some cases, return more info in the HTTP response.
  * alter internal provider hooks for: locks, repository, db.
  * internal conversion to new dav_lock data structure (not yet
    complete)
  * fixed some problems with inheriting locks upon a PUT or MKCOL
  * repository can signal that it can handle a GET request (John Vasta)
  * fix a crasher in saving locks with no owner
  * internal move/copy code cleaned up (John Vasta)
  * fix DAV:getcontenttype (it always returned the content type for
    the Request-URI rather than the "current" resource)
  * fix entity-tag code: DAV:getetag now returns quoted entity tags
    (per the RFC, an entity-tag is a quoted-string)
  * fix checks for If: header processing. in some cases, locked
    resources were allowed to be changed; in others, changes were
    erroneously prevented.
  * the lock owner is now saved, but problems still exist with its
    handling of XML namespaces and stuff.
  * in some cases, a lockdiscovery provided an absoluteURI; it is now
    a relativeURI (like the other cases where we return URIs)

  * fix LIBS problem in libdav.module.in
  * wrap mod_dav.h with extern "C"
  * fix bug: r->path_info can sometimes be NULL
  * fix problem with GET being too aggressive (mod_dav should be more
    care in deciding to handle these)
  * implement DAV:getcontenttype and DAV:getcontentlanguage. these are
    also r/w propertie. Currently, they are not returned as headers
    during a GET.
  * revise liveprop handling
  * revise lockdb structure into public/private portion
  * perform std If-* checks during If: and lock validation (Joe Orton)
  * limit scope of the DAV directives (Keith Wannamaker)

  * Added internal APIs for replaceable subsystems. (John Vasta)
  * Added DAVMinTimeout directive (Keith Wannamaker)
  * ./configure improvements and fixes
  * change building of files in APXS case -- compile "outside" of the
    Apache build system and only use APXS to link. This eliminates the
    sdbm_combined.[ch] thing
  * fix building of libdav.so when inside the Apache tree (add the
    dav_shared_stub.c thing)
  * fix problem in remove_locknull_member() to prevent spamming the
    log with errors about not being able to locate the .locknull file.

Version 0.9.9-1.3.6 (released 15-Aug-1999)

  * Class 2 DAV functionality (locking) (Keith Wannamaker)
  * switch to the autoconf utilities for configuration (Rasmus
    Lerdorf, Greg)
  * bump propdb version to 4: old prop databases could have invalid
    property values in them (the "no namespace" bug noted below)
  * add util/fixvers tool to force an update of propdbs to V4
  * initial rollback support for PROPPATCH
  * fix the PROPPATCH responses when an error occurs
  * fix an IE5 problem where the Destination: header has an
    unqualified hostname (Keith Wannamaker)
  * fix an XML parsing bug: xmlns="" did not reset the default
    namespace to be "no namespace"
  * fix AIX build (via autoconf magic) (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * add MS-Author-Via header to OPTIONS response
  * refine the OPTIONS response (Keith Wannamaker, Greg)

  * initial sketch of dynamic extension support
  * add support for directly opening *DBM files (rather than requiring
    them to be in the state directory) (Keith Wannamaker)
  * DAV:getetag property support (Keith Wannamaker)
  * If: header processing (Keith Wannamaker)
  * enable Win32 support (Keith Wannamaker, John Vasta)

Version 0.9.8-1.3.6 (released 06-Apr-1999)

  * bump propdb version to 3: old propdb databases could have invalid
    property values in them.
  * fix bad bug in property value namespace handling. The child
    elements of a value were not being remapped from the input
    namespace indices to the propdb indices.
  * some refinements in the MOVE/COPY validation code
  * XML processing fixes:
    - attributes do not use the default namespace. if they do not have
      a prefix, then they have "no namespace"
    - never generate "our" XML using the default namespace. the
      default namespace must be reserved for elements that reside in
      the "no namespace" space (it is illegal to use a prefix to refer
      to the "no namespace" concept)
      Net result: we use xmlns:D="DAV:" now
    - revise code to NOT place an empty URI int the namespace table to
      mean "no namespace". instead, it must be handled with a special
      constant. we already had this: DAV_NS_XML was renamed to
      DAV_NS_NONE. it means "do not prepend a namespace prefix"
    - some simplifications of the parsing code (dav_find_prefix and
      the stuff related to DAV_NS_NONE)
    - looks like properties named xml...:name would have been
      generated improperly in a PROPFIND result (a prefix would have
      been added). now fixed.
  * misc comment fixes/updates
  * fix processing of r->allowed (from Ken Coar)
  * conform to Apache-standard formatting
  * check for leading "xml" in NS prefixes is now case-insignificant

Version 0.9.7-1.3.4 (released 23-Feb-1999)

  * MOVE/COPY Destination now defaults the port number
  * MOVE/COPY will now authorize the Destination
  * improve error handling for dav_delete_propset and
    dav_copymove_propset: return dav_response structures rather than
    directly logging an error. similarly, change the return value for
    dav_copymove_file. added save_errno to dav_response for support.
  * fix cross-device MOVEs
  * added some initial work for the SEARCH method from Matthew Parry:
    some new configuration directives plus empty method handler.
  * small fix for HP/UX -- it does not have run-time aggregate struct
    initialization.
  * shift most STATE directory/file handling under the propdb hooks;
    add general state file handling function: dav_copymove_state()
  * add storage of xml:lang values (and other xml:lang handling)
  * update propdb internal version to V2: language values added
  * add SDBM to the distribution. updated Makefile.tmpl and
    Makefile.apxs files.
  * encapsulate propdb access under a hook (vtable) design
  * move GDBM usage into dav_dbm.c covered by the hooks
  * add SDBM usage into dav_dbm.c
  * removed unnecessary RULE_HIDE from libdav.module

Version 0.9.6-1.3.4 (released 31-Jan-1999)

  * switch to new Apache-style license (see LICENSE.html)
  * remove 1.3.3 compatibility; in other words, require 1.3.4
  * small tweaks to insert a couple newlines into XML response text
  * fix small bug where we erroneously trapped POST requests
  * minor nits in the header comments
  * update copyrights to include 1999

Version 0.9.5-1.3.3 (released 13-Dec-1998)

  * more tweaks to the INSTALL file
  * update Makefile.apxs for more flexibility
  * change mod_dav.[ch] to allow mod_dav to work with Apache 1.3.4-dev
  * update dav_props for versioning
  * initial pass (not yet enabled) at storing xml:lang with properties
  * refine dav_open_propdb(), dav_propdb_error() error handling
  * ignore namespace prefixes beginning with "xml" (reserved for XML).
    These are stored in the propdb unchanged (e.g. they are passed thru)
  * internal propdb refinements w.r.t unknown keys in the db (future-proof)
  * move XML utilities from dav_xmlparse.c to dav_util.c. add new
    dav_empty_elem() function.
  * fix small bug in XML to text translation w.r.t size computation of
    attributes.
  * add xml:lang processing (but not storage yet)
  * default namespaces are properly handled now -- it no longer
    assumes that an empty prefix at the top-level means DAV:
  * "no namespace" is understood and handled properly. the default
    namespace now implies "no namespace" rather than DAV:

Version 0.9.4-1.3.3 (released 07-Dec-1998)

  * fixed slash handling in COPY, MOVE, and MKCOL
  * internal work on namespace handling (preparations to be able to
    handle xml:lang and other "xml" prefixes)
  * internal work to add hooks for external processing
    (from Stig Bakken)
  * updates to INSTALL

Version 0.9.3-1.3.3 (released 02-Dec-1998)

  * setting or deleting a property now returns more complex errors,
    but there is still some "flowing" that must happen.
  * looking up a URI for a COPY/MOVE returns more complex errors:
    - 502 (Bad Gateway) is now returned when appropriate
  * fixed a bunch of error responses to compensate for Apache 1.3.3's
    new error response mechanism (it is harder for us to simply
    override). There is now a dav_error_response() function to return
    an error message similar to Apache's, but with our own custom
    response body.
  * The following response status codes now have a proper body:
    - 201 (Created)
    - 403 (Forbidden)
    - 409 (Conflict)
    - 412 (Precondition Failed)
  * cleaned up some actual error message text.
  * fixed some return values from the handler (we needed to return
    DONE more often).
  * added additional COPY/MOVE check for the case where the
    Destination contains the Source (only had the reverse check in
    before).
  * fixed stupid bug in Overwrite: header handling
  * fixed some response handling of DAV: properties (sometimes the
    "good" values would not be returned)
  * removed the silly newline in the <multistatus> response

Version 0.9.2-1.3.3 (released 16-Nov-1998)

  * fixed URI handling for directories; a double slash would occur when
    the Request-URI as terminated in a slash (which is the "proper" format
    for a collection/directory request anyhow!).
  * fixed the broken PROPFIND <prop> response where: a property was not
    found, and the propdb was not present or the property's namespace was
    not present within the propdb.
  * add character set encoding info to responses
  * add Makefile.apxs to distribution
  * fixed crasher with DAV:resourcetype request


Version 0.9.1-1.3.3 (released 06-Nov-1998)

  * fixed: return live props even when no dead props exist
  * fixed: GET processing within DAV trees (don't handle GETs at all)
  * add INSTALL, mod_dav.module, and expanded README (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * register the module/version with Apache (Rasmus Lerdorf)
  * update to Apache 1.3.3


Version 0.9.0-1.3.2 (released 05-Nov-1998)

  * Initial release
