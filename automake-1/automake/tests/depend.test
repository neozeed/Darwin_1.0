# This tests for a bug reported by Henrik Frystyk Nielsen <frystyk@w3.org>
# In some cases the auto-dependency can get confused and try
# to `-include' a directory.
# This actually tests for two bugs:
# * A configure substitution in _SOURCES incorrectly ends up in DEP_FILES
# * A backslash-newline in _SOURCES causes just the directory to
#   appear in DEP_FILES.
