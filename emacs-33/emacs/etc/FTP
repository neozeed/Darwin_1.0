How to get GNU Software by Internet FTP or by UUCP.  Last updated 1998-06-05

* Please send improvements to this file to gnu@gnu.org.

* No Warranties

We distribute software in the hope that it will be useful, but without
any warranty.  No author or distributor of this software accepts
responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using it or for
whether it serves any particular purpose or works at all, unless he
says so in writing.

* Updates

If you find this file in the Emacs distribution, there is a chance it
is out of date.  If you plan to FTP files from a GNU FTP host, you
might as well start by FTPing the current version of this file, which
is `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'.

* How to FTP

Use the ftp program on your system (ask locally if you can't find it)
to connect to the host you are ftping from.  Unless indicated
otherwise, login in as user "anonymous", with password: "your e-mail
address" and set "binary" mode (to transfer all eight bits in each
byte).

* FTPing GNU Software

** How to FTP GNU Emacs

If you are on the Internet (see also "** Alternative Internet FTP
Sources" below), you can at present copy the latest distribution
version of GNU Emacs from the file /pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar.gz on host
ftp.gnu.org.  M and N stand for version numbers; look
at a listing of the directory through ftp to see what version is
available.  This gzip'd file is about 12 megabytes long; it expands
to about 45 megabytes.  After you unpack the distribution, be sure
to look at the files README and INSTALL.

Because of difficulties in transferring large files, sometimes a split
version of the tar file is created.  This would be in a directory
named /pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar-split or perhaps
/pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar.gz-split, containing files of 100000 characters
each.  There is generally no trouble in ftping files of this size.
They can be combined with cat to make a tar file or compressed tar
file.  If you can't find such files on ftp.gnu.org, have a look at
ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu.

ALWAYS USE BINARY/IMAGE MODE TO TRANSFER THESE FILES!
Text mode does not work for tar files or compressed files.

Files of differences from previous widely distributed GNU Emacs
versions to the present version are also available on ftp.gnu.org
under names of the form emacs-OO.OO-NN.NN.diff in directory /pub/gnu.
These are made with diff -rc2.  Sometimes there are versions
compressed with gzip of these difference files as well; their names
have .gz appended.

The Emacs manual in source form is included in the distribution.  The
dvi file produced by TeX is not included, but a copy may be available
for ftp under the name /pub/gnu/emacs.dvi.

The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is in a separate file:
	/pub/gnu/elisp-manual-NN.tar.gz

** VMS FTP sites with GNU Software
You can anonymously ftp a VMS version of GNU emacs from:
	- ftp.vms.stacken.kth.se:[.GNU-VMS] - GNU Emacs and some other VMS
ports (and some VMS binaries) of GNU software
	- mango.rsmas.miami.edu has a VMS version of the GCC/G++ compiler.
Contact angel@flipper.miami.edu (angel li) for details.
	- RIGEL.EFD.LTH.SE [130.235.48.3] - GNU Emacs 

** Other GNU Software and How To FTP It

Other GNU software is available on ftp.gnu.org under the directory
/pub/gnu.  diff files to convert between versions (like those used for
GNU Emacs) exist for some of these programs.  Some programs have misc
support files as well.  Have a look on prep to see which ones.
Compressed versions of the tar or diff files are often available
(indicated by a .gz suffix and made with the `gzip' program).  Some of
this software is in beta test (probably still buggy), and is being
made available for use by hackers who like to test software.

The file /pub/gnu/DESCRIPTIONS has a list of the packages distributed
on ftp.gnu.org with a brief description explaining what
each one can be used for.

More information about these programs can typically be found in the
GNU's Bulletin.  To receive a copy, write to gnu@gnu.org.

** Scheme and How to FTP It

The latest distribution version of C Scheme is available via anonymous FTP
from swiss-ftp.ai.mit.edu in /pub/scheme-X.X/ (where X.X is some version
number).

Read the files INSTALL and README in the top level C Scheme directory.

** TeX and How to Obtain It

We don't distribute TeX now, but it is free software.

TeX is a document formatter that is used, among other things, by the FSF
for all its documentation.  You will need it if you want to make printed
manuals.

TeX is freely redistributable.  You can get it by ftp, tape, or CD/ROM.

*** For FTP instructions, retrieve the file
ftp.cs.umb.edu/pub/tex/unixtex.ftp. (We don't include it here because it
changes relatively frequently.  Sorry.)

*** A minimal TeX collection (enough to process Texinfo files, anyway)
is included on the GNU source CD-ROM.  See the file ORDERS in this
directory for more information.

** Alternative Internet FTP Sources

A possibly more up-to-date list of GNU FTP sites is at URL
        http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

Please do NOT use a site outside your country, until you have checked
all sites inside your country, and then your continent.  Trans-ocean
TCP/IP links are very expensive and usually very low speed.

The canonical GNU ftp site is located at ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu.
You should probably use one of the many mirrors of that site - the
mirrors will be less busy, and you can find one closer to your site.

* Getting GNU software in Great Britain

jpo@cs.nott.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources he has
available.  The smaller items are available from the info-server (send
to info-server@cs.nott.ac.uk); the larger items by negotiation.  Due to
communication costs this service is only available within the UK.

BattenIG@computer-science.birmingham.ac.uk (aka
I.G.Batten@fulcrum.bt.co.uk) is also willing to distribute those GNU
sources he has.

wizards@doc.ic.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources they have
along with most other freely distributable software.  The SunSITE archive
on SunSITE.doc.ic.ac.uk (193.63.255.4) is available via ftp, http, fsp,
gopher, NFS and Lanmanger over IP (SMB), and telnet.

UK sites with just anonymous FTP access are in the above list.

* Getting GNU software via UUCP

OSU is distributing via UUCP: most GNU software, MIT C Scheme,
Compress, News, RN, NNTP, Patch, some Appletalk stuff, some of the
Internet Requests For Comment (RFC) et al..  See their periodic
postings on the Usenet newsgroup comp.sources.d for informational
updates.  Current details from <staff@cis.ohio-state.edu> or
<...!osu-cis!staff>.

Information on how to uucp some GNU programs is available via
electronic mail from: uunet!hutch!barber, hqda-ai!merlin, acornrc!bob,
hao!scicom!qetzal!upba!ugn!nepa!denny, ncar!noao!asuvax!hrc!dan,
bigtex!james (aka james@bigtex.cactus.org), oli-stl!root,
src@contrib.de (Germany), toku@dit.co.jp (Japan) and info@ftp.uu.net.

If you like the software developed and distributed by the Free
Software Foundation, please express your satisfaction with a donation.
Your donations will help to support the Foundation and make our future
