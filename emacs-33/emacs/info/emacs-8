Registering a File for Version Control
......................................

   You can put any file under version control by simply visiting it, and
then typing `C-x v i' (`vc-register').

`C-x v i'
     Register the visited file for version control.

   To register the file, Emacs must choose which version control system
to use for it.  You can specify your choice explicitly by setting
`vc-default-back-end' to `RCS', `CVS' or `SCCS'.  Otherwise, if there
is a subdirectory named `RCS', `SCCS', or `CVS', Emacs uses the
corresponding version control system.  In the absence of any
specification, the default choice is RCS if RCS is installed, otherwise
SCCS.

   If locking is in use,`C-x v i' leaves the file unlocked and
read-only.  Type `C-x C-q' if you wish to start editing it.  After
registering a file with CVS, you must subsequently commit the initial
version by typing `C-x C-q'.

   The initial version number for a newly registered file is 1.1, by
default.  You can specify a different default by setting the variable
`vc-default-init-version', or you can give `C-x v i' a numeric
argument; then it reads the initial version number for this particular
file using the minibuffer.

   If `vc-initial-comment' is non-`nil', `C-x v i' reads an initial
comment to describe the purpose of this source file.  Reading the
initial comment works like reading a log entry (*note Log Buffer::.).

VC Status Commands
..................

`C-x v l'
     Display version control state and change history.

   To view the detailed version control status and history of a file,
type `C-x v l' (`vc-print-log').  It displays the history of changes to
the current file, including the text of the log entries.  The output
appears in a separate window.

Undoing Version Control Actions
...............................

`C-x v u'
     Revert the buffer and the file to the last checked-in version.

`C-x v c'
     Remove the last-entered change from the master for the visited
     file.  This undoes your last check-in.

   If you want to discard your current set of changes and revert to the
last version checked in, use `C-x v u' (`vc-revert-buffer').  This
leaves the file unlocked; if locking is in use, you must first lock the
file again before you change it again.  `C-x v u' requires
confirmation, unless it sees that you haven't made any changes since the
last checked-in version.

   `C-x v u' is also the command to unlock a file if you lock it and
then decide not to change it.

   To cancel a change that you already checked in, use `C-x v c'
(`vc-cancel-version').  This command discards all record of the most
recent checked-in version.  `C-x v c' also offers to revert your work
file and buffer to the previous version (the one that precedes the
version that is deleted).

   If you answer `no', VC keeps your changes in the buffer, and locks
the file.  The no-revert option is useful when you have checked in a
change and then discover a trivial error in it; you can cancel the
erroneous check-in, fix the error, and check the file in again.

   When `C-x v c' does not revert the buffer, it unexpands all version
control headers in the buffer instead (*note Version Headers::.).  This
is because the buffer no longer corresponds to any existing version.
If you check it in again, the check-in process will expand the headers
properly for the new version number.

   However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS `$Log: emacs-8,v $
   However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS `Revision 1.1.1.2  1999/09/02 05:32:48  wsanchez
   However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS `Import of emacs-20.3
   However, it is impossible to unexpand the RCS `' header
automatically.  If you use that header feature, you have to unexpand it
by hand--by deleting the entry for the version that you just canceled.

   Be careful when invoking `C-x v c', as it is easy to lose a lot of
work with it.  To help you be careful, this command always requires
confirmation with `yes'.  Note also that this command is disabled under
CVS, because canceling versions is very dangerous and discouraged with
CVS.

Dired under VC
..............

   When you are working on a large program, it is often useful to find
out which files have changed within an entire directory tree, or to view
the status of all files under version control at once, and to perform
version control operations on collections of files.  You can use the
command `C-x v d' (`vc-directory') to make a directory listing that
includes only files relevant for version control.

   `C-x v d' creates a buffer which uses VC Dired Mode.  This looks
much like an ordinary Dired buffer (*note Dired::.); however, normally
it shows only the noteworthy files (those locked or not up-to-date).
This is called "terse display".  If you set the variable
`vc-dired-terse-display' to `nil', then VC Dired shows all relevant
files--those managed under version control, plus all subdirectories
("full display").  The command `v t' in a VC Dired buffer toggles
between terse display and full display (*note VC Dired Commands::.).

   By default, VC Dired produces a recursive listing of noteworthy or
relevant files at or below the given directory.  You can change this by
setting the variable `vc-dired-recurse' to `nil'; then VC Dired shows
only the files in the given directory.

   The line for an individual file shows the version control state in
the place of the hard link count, owner, group, and size of the file.
If the file is unmodified, in sync with the master file, the version
control state shown is blank.  Otherwise it consists of text in
parentheses.  Under RCS and SCCS, the name of the user locking the file
is shown; under CVS, an abbreviated version of the `cvs status' output
is used.  Here is an example using RCS:

     /home/jim/project:
     
       -rw-r--r-- (jim)      Apr  2 23:39 file1
       -r--r--r--            Apr  5 20:21 file2

The files `file1' and `file2' are under version control, `file1' is
locked by user jim, and `file2' is unlocked.

   Here is an example using CVS:

     /home/joe/develop:
     
       -rw-r--r-- (modified) Aug  2  1997 file1.c
       -rw-r--r--            Apr  4 20:09 file2.c
       -rw-r--r-- (merge)    Sep 13  1996 file3.c

   Here `file1.c' is modified with respect to the repository, and
`file2.c' is not.  `file3.c' is modified, but other changes have also
been checked in to the repository--you need to merge them with the work
file before you can check it in.

   When VC Dired displays subdirectories (in the "full" display mode),
it omits some that should never contain any files under version control.
By default, this includes Version Control subdirectories such as `RCS'
and `CVS'; you can customize this by setting the variable
`vc-directory-exclusion-list'.

   You can fine-tune VC Dired's format by typing `C-u x v d'--as in
ordinary Dired, that allows you to specify additional switches for the
`ls' command.

VC Dired Commands
.................

   All the usual Dired commands work normally in VC Dired mode, except
for `v', which is redefined as the version control prefix.  You can
invoke VC commands such as `vc-diff' and `vc-print-log' by typing `v
=', or `v l', and so on.  Most of these commands apply to the file name
on the current line.

   The command `v v' (`vc-next-action') operates on all the marked
files, so that you can lock or check in several files at once.  If it
operates on more than one file, it handles each file according to its
current state; thus, it might lock one file, but check in another file.
This could be confusing; it is up to you to avoid confusing behavior
by marking a set of files that are in a similar state.

   If any files call for check-in, `v v' reads a single log entry, then
uses it for all the files being checked in.  This is convenient for
registering or checking in several files at once, as part of the same
change.

   You can toggle between terse display (only locked files, or files not
up-to-date) and full display at any time by typing `v t'
`vc-dired-toggle-terse-mode'.  There is also a special command `* l'
(`vc-dired-mark-locked'), which marks all files currently locked (or,
with CVS, all files not up-to-date).  Thus, typing `* l t k' is another
way to delete from the buffer all files except those currently locked.


File: emacs,  Node: Branches,  Next: Snapshots,  Prev: Secondary VC Commands,  Up: Version Control

Multiple Branches of a File
---------------------------

   One use of version control is to maintain multiple "current"
versions of a file.  For example, you might have different versions of a
program in which you are gradually adding various unfinished new
features.  Each such independent line of development is called a
"branch".  VC allows you to create branches, switch between different
branches, and merge changes from one branch to another.  Please note,
however, that branches are only supported for RCS at the moment.

   A file's main line of development is usually called the "trunk".
The versions on the trunk are normally numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.  At
any such version, you can start an independent branch.  A branch
starting at version 1.2 would have version number 1.2.1.1, and
consecutive versions on this branch would have numbers 1.2.1.2,
1.2.1.3, 1.2.1.4, and so on.  If there is a second branch also starting
at version 1.2, it would consist of versions 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2, 1.2.2.3,
etc.

   If you omit the final component of a version number, that is called a
"branch number".  It refers to the highest existing version on that
branch--the "head version" of that branch.  The branches in the example
above have branch numbers 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.

* Switching Branches::    How to get to another existing branch.
* Creating Branches::     How to start a new branch.
* Merging::               Transferring changes between branches.
* Multi-User Branching::  Multiple users working at multiple branches

Switching between Branches
..........................

   To switch between branches, type `C-u C-x C-q' and specify the
version number you want to select.  This version is then visited
*unlocked* (write-protected), so you can examine it before locking it.
Switching branches in this way is allowed only when the file is not
locked.

   You can omit the minor version number, thus giving only the branch
number; this takes you to the head version on the chosen branch.  If you
only type <RET>, Emacs goes to the highest version on the trunk.

   After you have switched to any branch (including the main branch),
you stay on it for subsequent VC commands, until you explicitly select
some other branch.


File: emacs,  Node: Creating Branches,  Next: Merging,  Prev: Switching Branches,  Up: Branches

Creating New Branches
.....................

   To create a new branch from a head version (one that is the latest in
the branch that contains it), first select that version if necessary,
lock it with `C-x C-q', and make whatever changes you want.  Then, when
you check in the changes, use `C-u C-x C-q'.  This lets you specify the
version number for the new version.  You should specify a suitable
branch number for a branch starting at the current version.  For
example, if the current version is 2.5, the branch number should be
2.5.1, 2.5.2, and so on, depending on the number of existing branches at
that point.

   To create a new branch at an older version (one that is no longer the
head of a branch), first select that version, then lock it with `C-x
C-q'.  You'll be asked to confirm, when you lock the old version, that
you really mean to create a new branch--if you say no, you'll be offered
a chance to lock the latest version instead.

   Then make your changes and type `C-x C-q' again to check in a new
version.  This automatically creates a new branch starting from the
selected version.  You need not specially request a new branch, because
that's the only way to add a new version at a point that is not the head
of a branch.

   After the branch is created, you "stay" on it.  That means that
subsequent check-ins create new versions on that branch.  To leave the
branch, you must explicitly select a different version with `C-u C-x
C-q'.  To transfer changes from one branch to another, use the merge
command, described in the next section.


File: emacs,  Node: Merging,  Next: Multi-User Branching,  Prev: Creating Branches,  Up: Branches

Merging Branches
................

   When you have finished the changes on a certain branch, you will
often want to incorporate them into the file's main line of development
(the trunk).  This is not a trivial operation, because development might
also have proceeded on the trunk, so that you must "merge" the changes
into a file that has already been changed otherwise.  VC allows you to
do this (and other things) with the `vc-merge' command.

`C-x v m (vc-merge)'
     Merge changes into the work file.

   `C-x v m' (`vc-merge') takes a set of changes and merges it into the
current version of the work file.  It first asks you for a branch
number or a pair of version numbers in the minibuffer.  Then it finds
the changes from that branch, or between the two versions you
specified, and merges them into the current version of the current file.

   As an example, suppose that you have finished a certain feature on
branch 1.3.1.  In the meantime, development on the trunk has proceeded
to version 1.5.  To merge the changes from the branch to the trunk,
first go to the head version of the trunk, by typing `C-u C-x C-q RET'.
Version 1.5 is now current.  If locking is used for the file, type
`C-x C-q' to lock version 1.5 so that you can change it.  Next, type
`C-x v m 1.3.1 RET'.  This takes the entire set of changes on branch
1.3.1 (relative to version 1.3, where the branch started, up to the
last version on the branch) and merges it into the current version of
the work file.  You can now check in the changed file, thus creating
version 1.6 containing the changes from the branch.

   It is possible to do further editing after merging the branch, before
the next check-in.  But it is usually wiser to check in the merged
version, then lock it and make the further changes.  This will keep a
better record of the history of changes.

   When you merge changes into a file that has itself been modified, the
changes might overlap.  We call this situation a "conflict", and
reconciling the conflicting changes is called "resolving a conflict".

   Whenever conflicts occur during merging, VC detects them, tells you
about them in the echo area, and asks whether you want help in merging.
If you say yes, it starts an Ediff session (*note Ediff: (ediff)Top.).

   If you say no, the conflicting changes are both inserted into the
file, surrounded by "conflict markers".  The example below shows how a
conflict region looks; the file is called `name' and the current master
file version with user B's changes in it is 1.11.

     <<<<<<< name
       USER A'S VERSION
     =======
       USER B'S VERSION
     >>>>>>> 1.11

   Then you can resolve the conflicts by editing the file manually.  Or
you can type `M-x vc-resolve-conflicts' after visiting the file.  This
starts an Ediff session, as described above.

Multi-User Branching
....................

   It is often useful for multiple developers to work simultaneously on
different branches of a file.  CVS allows this by default; for RCS, it
is possible if you create multiple source directories.  Each source
directory should have a link named `RCS' which points to a common
directory of RCS master files.  Then each source directory can have its
own choice of selected versions, but all share the same common RCS
records.

   This technique works reliably and automatically, provided that the
source files contain RCS version headers (*note Version Headers::.).
The headers enable Emacs to be sure, at all times, which version number
is present in the work file.

   If the files do not have version headers, you must instead tell Emacs
explicitly in each session which branch you are working on.  To do this,
first find the file, then type `C-u C-x C-q' and specify the correct
branch number.  This ensures that Emacs knows which branch it is using
during this particular editing session.

Snapshots
---------

   A "snapshot" is a named set of file versions (one for each
registered file) that you can treat as a unit.  One important kind of
snapshot is a "release", a (theoretically) stable version of the system
that is ready for distribution to users.

* Menu:

* Making Snapshots::		The snapshot facilities.
* Snapshot Caveats::		Things to be careful of when using snapshots.


File: emacs,  Node: Making Snapshots,  Next: Snapshot Caveats,  Up: Snapshots

Making and Using Snapshots
..........................

   There are two basic commands for snapshots; one makes a snapshot
with a given name, the other retrieves a named snapshot.

`C-x v s NAME <RET>'
     Define the last saved versions of every registered file in or
     under the current directory as a snapshot named NAME
     (`vc-create-snapshot').

`C-x v r NAME <RET>'
     For all registered files at or below the current directory level,
     select whatever versions correspond to the snapshot NAME
     (`vc-retrieve-snapshot').

     This command reports an error if any files are locked at or below
     the current directory, without changing anything; this is to avoid
     overwriting work in progress.

   A snapshot uses a very small amount of resources--just enough to
record the list of file names and which version belongs to the
snapshot.  Thus, you need not hesitate to create snapshots whenever
they are useful.

   You can give a snapshot name as an argument to `C-x v =' or `C-x v
~' (*note Old Versions::.).  Thus, you can use it to compare a snapshot
against the current files, or two snapshots against each other, or a
snapshot against a named version.


File: emacs,  Node: Snapshot Caveats,  Prev: Making Snapshots,  Up: Snapshots

Snapshot Caveats
................

   VC's snapshot facilities are modeled on RCS's named-configuration
support.  They use RCS's native facilities for this, so under VC
snapshots made using RCS are visible even when you bypass VC.

   For SCCS, VC implements snapshots itself.  The files it uses contain
name/file/version-number triples.  These snapshots are visible only
through VC.

   A snapshot is a set of checked-in versions.  So make sure that all
the files are checked in and not locked when you make a snapshot.

   File renaming and deletion can create some difficulties with
snapshots.  This is not a VC-specific problem, but a general design
issue in version control systems that no one has solved very well yet.

   If you rename a registered file, you need to rename its master along
with it (the command `vc-rename-file' does this automatically).  If you
are using SCCS, you must also update the records of the snapshot, to
mention the file by its new name (`vc-rename-file' does this, too).  An
old snapshot that refers to a master file that no longer exists under
the recorded name is invalid; VC can no longer retrieve it.  It would
be beyond the scope of this manual to explain enough about RCS and SCCS
to explain how to update the snapshots by hand.

   Using `vc-rename-file' makes the snapshot remain valid for
retrieval, but it does not solve all problems.  For example, some of the
files in the program probably refer to others by name.  At the very
least, the makefile probably mentions the file that you renamed.  If you
retrieve an old snapshot, the renamed file is retrieved under its new
name, which is not the name that the makefile expects.  So the program
won't really work as retrieved.

File: emacs,  Node: Change Logs and VC,  Next: Renaming and VC,  Up: Miscellaneous VC

Change Logs and VC
..................

   If you use RCS or CVS for a program and also maintain a change log
file for it (*note Change Log::.), you can generate change log entries
automatically from the version control log entries:

`C-x v a'
     Visit the current directory's change log file and, for registered
     files in that directory, create new entries for versions checked
     in since the most recent entry in the change log file.
     (`vc-update-change-log').

     This command works with RCS or CVS only, not with SCCS.

`C-u C-x v a'
     As above, but only find entries for the current buffer's file.

`M-1 C-x v a'
     As above, but find entries for all the currently visited files
     that are maintained with version control.  This works only with
     RCS, and it puts all entries in the log for the default directory,
     which may not be appropriate.

   For example, suppose the first line of `ChangeLog' is dated 10 April
1992, and that the only check-in since then was by Nathaniel Bowditch
to `rcs2log' on 8 May 1992 with log text `Ignore log messages that
start with `#'.'.  Then `C-x v a' visits `ChangeLog' and inserts text
like this:

     Fri May  8 21:45:00 1992  Nathaniel Bowditch  <nat@apn.org>
     
             * rcs2log: Ignore log messages that start with `#'.

You can then edit the new change log entry further as you wish.

   Normally, the log entry for file `foo' is displayed as `* foo: TEXT
OF LOG ENTRY'.  The `:' after `foo' is omitted if the text of the log
entry starts with `(FUNCTIONNAME): '.  For example, if the log entry
for `vc.el' is `(vc-do-command): Check call-process status.', then the
text in `ChangeLog' looks like this:

     Wed May  6 10:53:00 1992  Nathaniel Bowditch  <nat@apn.org>
     
             * vc.el (vc-do-command): Check call-process status.

   When `C-x v a' adds several change log entries at once, it groups
related log entries together if they all are checked in by the same
author at nearly the same time.  If the log entries for several such
files all have the same text, it coalesces them into a single entry.
For example, suppose the most recent check-ins have the following log
entries:

* For `vc.texinfo': `Fix expansion typos.'
* For `vc.el': `Don't call expand-file-name.'
* For `vc-hooks.el': `Don't call expand-file-name.'

They appear like this in `ChangeLog':

     Wed Apr  1 08:57:59 1992  Nathaniel Bowditch  <nat@apn.org>
     
             * vc.texinfo: Fix expansion typos.
     
             * vc.el, vc-hooks.el: Don't call expand-file-name.

   Normally, `C-x v a' separates log entries by a blank line, but you
can mark several related log entries to be clumped together (without an
intervening blank line) by starting the text of each related log entry
with a label of the form `{CLUMPNAME} '.  The label itself is not
copied to `ChangeLog'.  For example, suppose the log entries are:

* For `vc.texinfo': `{expand} Fix expansion typos.'
* For `vc.el': `{expand} Don't call expand-file-name.'
* For `vc-hooks.el': `{expand} Don't call expand-file-name.'

Then the text in `ChangeLog' looks like this:

     Wed Apr  1 08:57:59 1992  Nathaniel Bowditch  <nat@apn.org>
     
             * vc.texinfo: Fix expansion typos.
             * vc.el, vc-hooks.el: Don't call expand-file-name.

   A log entry whose text begins with `#' is not copied to `ChangeLog'.
For example, if you merely fix some misspellings in comments, you can
log the change with an entry beginning with `#' to avoid putting such
trivia into `ChangeLog'.

Renaming VC Work Files and Master Files
.......................................

   When you rename a registered file, you must also rename its master
file correspondingly to get proper results.  Use `vc-rename-file' to
rename the source file as you specify, and rename its master file
accordingly.  It also updates any snapshots (*note Snapshots::.) that
mention the file, so that they use the new name; despite this, the
snapshot thus modified may not completely work (*note Snapshot
Caveats::.).

   You cannot use `vc-rename-file' on a file that is locked by someone
else.


File: emacs,  Node: Version Headers,  Prev: Renaming and VC,  Up: Miscellaneous VC

Inserting Version Control Headers
.................................

   Sometimes it is convenient to put version identification strings
directly into working files.  Certain special strings called "version
headers" are replaced in each successive version by the number of that
version.

   If you are using RCS, and version headers are present in your working
files, Emacs can use them to determine the current version and the
locking state of the files.  This is more reliable than referring to the
master files, which is done when there are no version headers.  Note
that in a multi-branch environment, version headers are necessary to
make VC behave correctly (*note Multi-User Branching::.).

   Searching for version headers is controlled by the variable
`vc-consult-headers'.  If it is non-`nil', Emacs searches for headers
to determine the version number you are editing.  Setting it to `nil'
disables this feature.

   You can use the `C-x v h' command (`vc-insert-headers') to insert a
suitable header string.

`C-x v h'
     Insert headers in a file for use with your version-control system.

   The default header string is `$Id: emacs-8,v 1.1.1.2 1999/09/02 05:32:48 wsanchez Exp $' for RCS and `%W%' for SCCS.  You
can specify other headers to insert by setting the variable
`vc-header-alist'.  Its value is a list of elements of the form
`(PROGRAM . STRING)' where PROGRAM is `RCS' or `SCCS' and STRING is the
string to use.

   Instead of a single string, you can specify a list of strings; then
each string in the list is inserted as a separate header on a line of
its own.

   It is often necessary to use "superfluous" backslashes when writing
the strings that you put in this variable.  This is to prevent the
string in the constant from being interpreted as a header itself if the
Emacs Lisp file containing it is maintained with version control.

   Each header is inserted surrounded by tabs, inside comment
delimiters, on a new line at the start of the buffer.  Normally the
ordinary comment start and comment end strings of the current mode are
used, but for certain modes, there are special comment delimiters for
this purpose; the variable `vc-comment-alist' specifies them.  Each
element of this list has the form `(MODE STARTER ENDER)'.

   The variable `vc-static-header-alist' specifies further strings to
add based on the name of the buffer.  Its value should be a list of
elements of the form `(REGEXP . FORMAT)'.  Whenever REGEXP matches the
buffer name, FORMAT is inserted as part of the header.  A header line
is inserted for each element that matches the buffer name, and for each
string specified by `vc-header-alist'.  The header line is made by
processing the string from `vc-header-alist' with the format taken from
the element.  The default value for `vc-static-header-alist' is as
follows:

     (("\\.c$" .
       "\n#ifndef lint\nstatic char vcid[] = \"\%s\";\n\
     #endif /* lint */\n"))

It specifies insertion of text of this form:


     #ifndef lint
     static char vcid[] = "STRING";
     #endif /* lint */

Note that the text above starts with a blank line.

   If you use more than one version header in a file, put them close
together in the file.  The mechanism in `revert-buffer' that preserves
markers may not handle markers positioned between two version headers.

Customizing VC
--------------

   There are many ways of customizing VC.  The options you can set fall
into four categories, described in the following sections.

* Menu:

* Backend Options::       Customizing the back-end to your needs.
* VC Workfile Handling::  Various options concerning working files.
* VC Status Retrieval::   How VC finds the version control status of a file,
                            and how to customize this.
* VC Command Execution::  Which commands VC should run, and how.

Options for VC Backends
.......................

   You can tell RCS and CVS whether to use locking for a file or not
(*note VC Concepts::., for a description of locking).  VC automatically
recognizes what you have chosen, and behaves accordingly.

   For RCS, the default is to use locking, but there is a mode called
"non-strict locking" in which you can check-in changes without locking
the file first.  Use `rcs -U' to switch to non-strict locking for a
particular file, see the `rcs' manpage for details.

   Under CVS, the default is not to use locking; anyone can change a
work file at any time.  However, there are ways to restrict this,
resulting in behavior that resembles locking.

   For one thing, you can set the `CVSREAD' environment variable to an
arbitrary value.  If this variable is defined, CVS makes your work
files read-only by default.  In Emacs, you must type `C-x C-q' to make
the file writeable, so that editing works in fact similar as if locking
was used.  Note however, that no actual locking is performed, so
several users can make their files writeable at the same time.  When
setting `CVSREAD' for the first time, make sure to check out all your
modules anew, so that the file protections are set correctly.

   Another way to achieve something similar to locking is to use the
"watch" feature of CVS.  If a file is being watched, CVS makes it
read-only by default, and you must also use `C-x C-q' in Emacs to make
it writable.  VC calls `cvs edit' to make the file writeable, and CVS
takes care to notify other developers of the fact that you intend to
change the file.  See the CVS documentation for details on using the
watch feature.

   You can turn off use of VC for CVS-managed files by setting the
variable `vc-handle-cvs' to `nil'.  If you do this, Emacs treats these
files as if they were not registered, and the VC commands are not
available for them.  You must do all CVS operations manually.


File: emacs,  Node: VC Workfile Handling,  Next: VC Status Retrieval,  Prev: Backend Options,  Up: Customizing VC

VC Workfile Handling
....................

   Emacs normally does not save backup files for source files that are
maintained with version control.  If you want to make backup files even
for files that use version control, set the variable
`vc-make-backup-files' to a non-`nil' value.

   Normally the work file exists all the time, whether it is locked or
not.  If you set `vc-keep-workfiles' to `nil', then checking in a new
version with `C-x C-q' deletes the work file; but any attempt to visit
the file with Emacs creates it again.  (With CVS, work files are always
kept.)

   Editing a version-controlled file through a symbolic link can be
dangerous.  It bypasses the version control system--you can edit the
file without locking it, and fail to check your changes in.  Also, your
changes might overwrite those of another user.  To protect against
this, VC checks each symbolic link that you visit, to see if it points
to a file under version control.

   The variable `vc-follow-symlinks' controls what to do when a
symbolic link points to a version-controlled file.  If it is `nil', VC
only displays a warning message.  If it is `t', VC automatically
follows the link, and visits the real file instead, telling you about
this in the echo area.  If the value is `ask' (the default), VC asks
you each time whether to follow the link.


File: emacs,  Node: VC Status Retrieval,  Next: VC Command Execution,  Prev: VC Workfile Handling,  Up: Customizing VC

VC Status Retrieval
...................

   When deducing the locked/unlocked state of a file, VC first looks for
an RCS version header string in the file (*note Version Headers::.).  If
there is no header string, or if you are using SCCS, VC normally looks
at the file permissions of the work file; this is fast.  But there might
be situations when the file permissions cannot be trusted.  In this case
the master file has to be consulted, which is rather expensive.  Also
the master file can only tell you *if* there's any lock on the file,
but not whether your work file really contains that locked version.

   You can tell VC not to use version headers to determine lock status
by setting `vc-consult-headers' to `nil'.  VC then always uses the file
permissions (if it can trust them), or else checks the master file.

   You can specify the criterion for whether to trust the file
permissions by setting the variable `vc-mistrust-permissions'.  Its
value can be `t' (always mistrust the file permissions and check the
master file), `nil' (always trust the file permissions), or a function
of one argument which makes the decision.  The argument is the
directory name of the `RCS', `CVS' or `SCCS' subdirectory.  A non-`nil'
value from the function says to mistrust the file permissions.  If you
find that the file permissions of work files are changed erroneously,
set `vc-mistrust-permissions' to `t'.  Then VC always checks the master
file to determine the file's status.

VC Command Execution
....................

   If `vc-suppress-confirm' is non-`nil', then `C-x C-q' and `C-x v i'
can save the current buffer without asking, and `C-x v u' also operates
without asking for confirmation.  (This variable does not affect `C-x v
c'; that operation is so drastic that it should always ask for
confirmation.)

   VC mode does much of its work by running the shell commands for RCS,
CVS and SCCS.  If `vc-command-messages' is non-`nil', VC displays
messages to indicate which shell commands it runs, and additional
messages when the commands finish.

   You can specify additional directories to search for version control
programs by setting the variable `vc-path'.  These directories are
searched before the usual search path.  But the proper files are usually
found automatically.


File: emacs,  Node: Directories,  Next: Comparing Files,  Prev: Version Control,  Up: Files

File Directories
================

   The file system groups files into "directories".  A "directory
listing" is a list of all the files in a directory.  Emacs provides
commands to create and delete directories, and to make directory
listings in brief format (file names only) and verbose format (sizes,
dates, and authors included).  There is also a directory browser called
Dired; see *Note Dired::.

`C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN <RET>'
     Display a brief directory listing (`list-directory').

`C-u C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN <RET>'
     Display a verbose directory listing.

`M-x make-directory <RET> DIRNAME <RET>'
     Create a new directory named DIRNAME.

`M-x delete-directory <RET> DIRNAME <RET>'
     Delete the directory named DIRNAME.  It must be empty, or you get
     an error.

   The command to display a directory listing is `C-x C-d'
(`list-directory').  It reads using the minibuffer a file name which is
either a directory to be listed or a wildcard-containing pattern for
the files to be listed.  For example,

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/etc <RET>

lists all the files in directory `/u2/emacs/etc'.  Here is an example
of specifying a file name pattern:

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/src/*.c <RET>

   Normally, `C-x C-d' prints a brief directory listing containing just
file names.  A numeric argument (regardless of value) tells it to make
a verbose listing including sizes, dates, and authors (like `ls -l').

   The text of a directory listing is obtained by running `ls' in an
inferior process.  Two Emacs variables control the switches passed to
`ls': `list-directory-brief-switches' is a string giving the switches
to use in brief listings (`"-CF"' by default), and
`list-directory-verbose-switches' is a string giving the switches to
use in a verbose listing (`"-l"' by default).


File: emacs,  Node: Comparing Files,  Next: Misc File Ops,  Prev: Directories,  Up: Files

Comparing Files
===============

   The command `M-x diff' compares two files, displaying the
differences in an Emacs buffer named `*Diff*'.  It works by running the
`diff' program, using options taken from the variable `diff-switches',
whose value should be a string.

   The buffer `*Diff*' has Compilation mode as its major mode, so you
can use `C-x `' to visit successive changed locations in the two source
files.  You can also move to a particular hunk of changes and type
<RET> or `C-c C-c', or click `Mouse-2' on it, to move to the
corresponding source location.  You can also use the other special
commands of Compilation mode: <SPC> and <DEL> for scrolling, and `M-p'
and `M-n' for cursor motion.  *Note Compilation::.

   The command `M-x diff-backup' compares a specified file with its most
recent backup.  If you specify the name of a backup file, `diff-backup'
compares it with the source file that it is a backup of.

   The command `M-x compare-windows' compares the text in the current
window with that in the next window.  Comparison starts at point in each
window, and each starting position is pushed on the mark ring in its
respective buffer.  Then point moves forward in each window, a character
at a time, until a mismatch between the two windows is reached.  Then
the command is finished.  For more information about windows in Emacs,
*Note Windows::.

   With a numeric argument, `compare-windows' ignores changes in
whitespace.  If the variable `compare-ignore-case' is non-`nil', it
ignores differences in case as well.

   See also *Note Emerge::, for convenient facilities for merging two
similar files.

Miscellaneous File Operations
=============================

   Emacs has commands for performing many other operations on files.
All operate on one file; they do not accept wildcard file names.

   `M-x view-file' allows you to scan or read a file by sequential
screenfuls.  It reads a file name argument using the minibuffer.  After
reading the file into an Emacs buffer, `view-file' displays the
beginning.  You can then type <SPC> to scroll forward one windowful, or
<DEL> to scroll backward.  Various other commands are provided for
moving around in the file, but none for changing it; type `?'  while
viewing for a list of them.  They are mostly the same as normal Emacs
cursor motion commands.  To exit from viewing, type `q'.  The commands
for viewing are defined by a special major mode called View mode.

   A related command, `M-x view-buffer', views a buffer already present
in Emacs.  *Note Misc Buffer::.

   `M-x insert-file' inserts a copy of the contents of the specified
file into the current buffer at point, leaving point unchanged before
the contents and the mark after them.

   `M-x write-region' is the inverse of `M-x insert-file'; it copies
the contents of the region into the specified file.  `M-x
append-to-file' adds the text of the region to the end of the specified
file.  *Note Accumulating Text::.

   `M-x delete-file' deletes the specified file, like the `rm' command
in the shell.  If you are deleting many files in one directory, it may
be more convenient to use Dired (*note Dired::.).

   `M-x rename-file' reads two file names OLD and NEW using the
minibuffer, then renames file OLD as NEW.  If a file named NEW already
exists, you must confirm with `yes' or renaming is not done; this is
because renaming causes the old meaning of the name NEW to be lost.  If
OLD and NEW are on different file systems, the file OLD is copied and
deleted.

   The similar command `M-x add-name-to-file' is used to add an
additional name to an existing file without removing its old name.  The
new name must belong on the same file system that the file is on.

   `M-x copy-file' reads the file OLD and writes a new file named NEW
with the same contents.  Confirmation is required if a file named NEW
already exists, because copying has the consequence of overwriting the
old contents of the file NEW.

   `M-x make-symbolic-link' reads two file names TARGET and LINKNAME,
then creates a symbolic link named LINKNAME and pointing at TARGET.
The effect is that future attempts to open file LINKNAME will refer to
whatever file is named TARGET at the time the opening is done, or will
get an error if the name TARGET is not in use at that time.  This
command does not expand the argument TARGET, so that it allows you to
specify a relative name as the target of the link.

   Confirmation is required when creating the link if LINKNAME is in
use.  Note that not all systems support symbolic links.


File: emacs,  Node: Compressed Files,  Next: Remote Files,  Prev: Misc File Ops,  Up: Files

Accessing Compressed Files
==========================

   Emacs comes with a library that can automatically uncompress
compressed files when you visit them, and automatically recompress them
if you alter them and save them.  To enable this feature, type the
command `M-x auto-compression-mode'.

   When automatic compression (which implies automatic uncompression as
well) is enabled, Emacs recognizes compressed files by their file names.
File names ending in `.gz' indicate a file compressed with `gzip'.
Other endings indicate other compression programs.

   Automatic uncompression and compression apply to all the operations
in which Emacs uses the contents of a file.  This includes visiting it,
saving it, inserting its contents into a buffer, loading it, and byte
compiling it.


File: emacs,  Node: Remote Files,  Next: Quoted File Names,  Prev: Compressed Files,  Up: Files

Remote Files
============

   You can refer to files on other machines using a special file name
syntax:

     /HOST:FILENAME
     /USER@HOST:FILENAME

When you do this, Emacs uses the FTP program to read and write files on
the specified host.  It logs in through FTP using your user name or the
name USER.  It may ask you for a password from time to time; this is
used for logging in on HOST.

   Normally, if you do not specify a user name in a remote file name,
that means to use your own user name.  But if you set the variable
`ange-ftp-default-user' to a string, that string is used instead.  (The
Emacs package that implements FTP file access is called `ange-ftp'.)

   You can entirely turn off the FTP file name feature by setting the
variable `file-name-handler-alist' to `nil'.


File: emacs,  Node: Quoted File Names,  Prev: Remote Files,  Up: Files

Quoted File Names
=================

   You can "quote" an absolute file name to prevent special characters
and syntax in it from having their special effects.  The way to do this
is to add `/:' at the beginning.

   For example, you can quote a local file name which appears remote, to
prevent it from being treated as a remote file name.  Thus, if you have
a directory named `/foo:' and a file named `bar' in it, you can refer
to that file in Emacs as `/:/foo:/bar'.

   `/:' can also prevent `~' from being treated as a special character
for a user's home directory.  For example, `/:/tmp/~hack' refers to a
file whose name is `~hack' in directory `/tmp'.

   Likewise, quoting with `/:' is one way to enter in the minibuffer a
file name that contains `$'.  However, the `/:' must be at the
beginning of the buffer in order to quote `$'.


File: emacs,  Node: Buffers,  Next: Windows,  Prev: Files,  Up: Top

Using Multiple Buffers
**********************

   The text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a
"buffer".  Each time you visit a file, a buffer is created to hold the
file's text.  Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is created to hold
the directory listing.  If you send a message with `C-x m', a buffer
named `*mail*' is used to hold the text of the message.  When you ask
for a command's documentation, that appears in a buffer called `*Help*'.

   At any time, one and only one buffer is "selected".  It is also
called the "current buffer".  Often we say that a command operates on
"the buffer" as if there were only one; but really this means that the
command operates on the selected buffer (most commands do).

   When Emacs has multiple windows, each window has a chosen buffer
which is displayed there, but at any time only one of the windows is
selected and its chosen buffer is the selected buffer.  Each window's
mode line displays the name of the buffer that the window is displaying
(*note Windows::.).

   Each buffer has a name, which can be of any length, and you can
select any buffer by giving its name.  Most buffers are made by
visiting files, and their names are derived from the files' names.  But
you can also create an empty buffer with any name you want.  A newly
started Emacs has a buffer named `*scratch*' which can be used for
evaluating Lisp expressions in Emacs.  The distinction between upper
and lower case matters in buffer names.

   Each buffer records individually what file it is visiting, whether
it is modified, and what major mode and minor modes are in effect in it
(*note Major Modes::.).  Any Emacs variable can be made "local to" a
particular buffer, meaning its value in that buffer can be different
from the value in other buffers.  *Note Locals::.

File: emacs,  Node: Select Buffer,  Next: List Buffers,  Up: Buffers

Creating and Selecting Buffers
==============================

`C-x b BUFFER <RET>'
     Select or create a buffer named BUFFER (`switch-to-buffer').

`C-x 4 b BUFFER <RET>'
     Similar, but select BUFFER in another window
     (`switch-to-buffer-other-window').

`C-x 5 b BUFFER <RET>'
     Similar, but select BUFFER in a separate frame
     (`switch-to-buffer-other-frame').

   To select the buffer named BUFNAME, type `C-x b BUFNAME <RET>'.
This runs the command `switch-to-buffer' with argument BUFNAME.  You
can use completion on an abbreviation for the buffer name you want
(*note Completion::.).  An empty argument to `C-x b' specifies the most
recently selected buffer that is not displayed in any window.

   Most buffers are created by visiting files, or by Emacs commands that
want to display some text, but you can also create a buffer explicitly
by typing `C-x b BUFNAME <RET>'.  This makes a new, empty buffer that
is not visiting any file, and selects it for editing.  Such buffers are
used for making notes to yourself.  If you try to save one, you are
asked for the file name to use.  The new buffer's major mode is
determined by the value of `default-major-mode' (*note Major Modes::.).

   Note that `C-x C-f', and any other command for visiting a file, can
also be used to switch to an existing file-visiting buffer.  *Note
Visiting::.

   Emacs uses buffer names that start with a space for internal
purposes.  It treats these buffers specially in minor ways--for
example, by default they do not record undo information.  It is best to
avoid using such buffer names yourself.


File: emacs,  Node: List Buffers,  Next: Misc Buffer,  Prev: Select Buffer,  Up: Buffers

Listing Existing Buffers
========================

`C-x C-b'
     List the existing buffers (`list-buffers').

   To display a list of all the buffers that exist, type `C-x C-b'.
Each line in the list shows one buffer's name, major mode and visited
file.  The buffers are listed in the order that they were current; the
buffers that were current most recently come first.

   `*' at the beginning of a line indicates the buffer is "modified."
If several buffers are modified, it may be time to save some with `C-x
s' (*note Saving::.).  `%' indicates a read-only buffer.  `.' marks the
selected buffer.  Here is an example of a buffer list:

      MR Buffer         Size  Mode           File
      -- ------         ----  ----           ----

         *scratch*	   0	 Lisp Interaction

Note that the buffer `*Help*' was made by a help request; it is not
visiting any file.  The buffer `man' was made by Dired on the directory
`/u2/emacs/man/'.
