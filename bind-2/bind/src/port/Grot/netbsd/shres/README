BIND 4.9.3 resolver support for SunOS 4.x compatible shared libraries
=====================================================================

This directory contains the makefile and scripts necessary to install
the new 4.9.3 resolver into your existing SunOS-4.x compatible libc.so
shared library binary.

These procedures have been tested on SunOS-4.1.1_U1 (sun-3),
SunOS-4.1.4, NetBSD-1.0, and NetBSD-1.1.  They are very likely to work
on OpenBSD, and may work on FreeBSD-2.x.  Since BSDI's BSD/386 1.1 does
not support shared libraries, don't try this there, but you may have
some luck with BSDI's BSD/386 2.x.

You should read through this whole file, *and* the relevant INSTALL
file, BEFORE BEGINNING.  I mean it.  I really mean it.  The shared
library is the second most important part of a functional operating
system (right next in line to the kernel itself).  If you screw it up
you will be very very unhappy and so will your users.  As always you
should have regular backups of everything.

WARNING:  For SunOS-4.x see README.SunOS before beginning.

NOTES about this new release:

1. makeshlib can now rebuild shared libraries for either SunOS-4.x or
   4.4BSDs that use the SunOS-4.x shared libraries.

2. makeshlib determines the system type automatically by what 'uname'
   returns.  Make sure that 'uname' is in your path.  (This shouldn't be
   a problem since it's in /usr/bin on both systems)

3. If the script can't find your shared library object files or you haven't
   built libresolv_pic.a, it will exit immediately, instead of failing on
   later commands.

4. The shared libraries are rebuilt in the current directory (and
   temporary directories underneath it), instead of in SHLIBDIR.  NetBSD
   and other 4.4bsd's use /usr/lib for SHLIBDIR, and rebuilding them
   under /usr/lib did not seem like the appropriate place for this
   operation.

5. You have the option (by setting USELORDER at the top of the script)
   to dynamically generate an lorder-sparc file using lorder on a SunOS
   machine.  Using Sun's lorder-sparc file may arguably reduce the
   amount of paging of the shared library code, and doesn't take as
   long.  On the other hand, since it is generated from the list of
   object files that are actually present, you don't have to worry too
   much about the file getting out of order somehow.  NetBSD and other
   4.4bsds will always dynamically generate this list, as this is the
   method it uses when the system shared libraries are built, so
   unsetting this variable on a NetBSD machine has no effect.

6. Larry Wall's patch program is no longer require to make the
   modifications to the lorder-sparc file under SunOS if you use it or
   to the Makefile in /usr/lib/shlib.etc.  A sed script will modify the
   lorder-sparc file, and the Makefile is no longer used.
