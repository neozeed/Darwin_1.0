Installing BIND 4.9.3 resolver code in SunOS compatible shared libraries
========================================================================

fixes for SunOS-4.x and NetBSD-1.1 by Greg A. Woods <woods@planix.com>

based directly on documentation for installing SunOS shared libraries
by Chris Davis <ckd@kei.com>

based on code and documentation by:
  Paul Balyoz <pab@naucse.cse.nau.edu>
  Piete Brooks <pb@cl.cam.ac.uk>
  Dave Morrison <drmorris@mit.edu>
  Hal Pomeranz <pomeranz@nas.nasa.gov>

and probably others (apologies if I've forgotten you).

1.  Get and unpack a copy of BIND 4.9.3.  (This document is from that
    distribution, as shres/netbsd/INSTALL.) See <URL:http://www.isc.org/isc/> 
    for more information, including a pointer to the latest version.

    In the remainder of this document, $BINDSRC represents the directory
    you unpacked the BIND distribution into.

2.  Configure it to your tastes by editing $BINDSRC/conf/options.h,
    using $BINDSRC/OPTIONS as a guide to the available choices.  Not all
    of the options affect the resolver library, but you probably want
    the new named as well.  The one supplied with NetBSD 1.0 is from
    BIND 4.8.3.

3.  (Optional) Use "make DST=NetBSD links" to create a shadow source
    tree for the NetBSD architecture (see $BINDSRC/README for details).
    This is particularly useful if you are building for more than one
    architecture or operating system (like, say, SunOS 4.1.x and Solaris
    2.x).  If you do this, cd into the new build directory ("cd NetBSD",
    for example).

4.  Uncomment the appropriate lines in $BINDSRC/Makefile for NetBSD 1.x,
    FreeBSD 2.x, BSDI-2.x, or SunOS-4.x.  To build a shared library (the
    goal of this section) also set the SHRES macro to "shres/netbsd".

5.  (Optional) run "make depend".

6.  Type "make" to build named, the tools, the "normal" libresolv, and
    the position-independent code ("pic") libresolv_pic.

7.  Build and install the new library with the makeshlib script:

	sh ./makeshlib

    NOTE:  You will have to be in the $BINDSRC/shres/netbsd directory
    before running this script.

    WARNING:  The makeshlib script does minimal error checking -- it
    only runs the 'date' command with the new library.

    Note that you will have to be "root" for the final install of the
    library to succeed.  You should read the makeshlib script carefully
    before running it as root.

    You may wish to use "sh -x ./makeshlib" to view the commands as
    they are executed as a progress indicator.

8.  Once you are fully confident of your new library, reboot your
    machine.  Until you do, running processes will continue to use the
    old shared library.

NOTE: This version of BIND does not update /usr/lib/libc.a.  Use
"-lresolv" when linking new static programs to ensure use of the new
BIND 4.9.3 resolver routines.
