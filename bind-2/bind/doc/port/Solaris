Subject: BIND and Solaris shared library
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Sun has released a patch for Solaris 2.4 which addresses a security hole in
their implementation of name/address resolution using DNS.  Anyone who is
running Solaris 2.4 with DNS specified in their /etc/nsswitch.conf file should
apply this patch.  This is true whether you are using the BIND 4.9.3 beta
supplied version of the resolver shared library or the stock Solaris version.

A note should be added to the shres/solaris ISSUES file telling users that
they should get and apply patch 102165-02 to their Solaris system if they want
to use DNS as a hostname resolution method.

The relevant portion of the README file from the patch is included below.
Note that this patch is only available for the SPARC architecture, although
the security hole applies to x86 architecture as well.

Problem Description:

1207777 adding the 102167 patch adds a new security hole and increases traffic/delays

(from 102165-01)

1174876 DNS spoofing possible in 5.3 when using DNS via /usr/lib/nss_dns.so.1

This patch protects the Name Service Switch (DNS Domain Name Service) backend
from DNS spoofing.  I.e. a hacker maps an IP address they own to a hostname
that someone trusts (ex. 10.1.0.35 owned by Hacker.COM, to Trusted-host.my.com)
allowing them to perhaps rlogin to another machine.  The solution done in 4.x
and the resolver library is after doing a gethostbyaddr() to do a gethostbyname() and check that the IP address given is one that belongs to
the returned hostname.

If IP address passed into gethostbyaddr() does not match an IP address returned
from the gethostbyname() call a SPOOFING error message is syslog-ed and the gethostbyaddr() call returns failure (NOTFOUND).  If the gethostbyname() call
FAILS, then the hostname is returned.  This is because some people like to register IP addresses BUT not the hostnames in DNS (don't ask why, security through obscurity I guess).

(We will ignore the entire question of basing "security" on IP addresses)
