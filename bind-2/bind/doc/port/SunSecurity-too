[ Steve Bellovin's comment on this:
	the advice in conf/Info.SunSecurity-too is wrong and dangerous.  Sun
	systems have at least one daemon (rpc.mountd) that can't be protected
	by Wietse's code but rely on SUNSECURITY for protection.

We don't use SUNSECURITY on our suns, we use a package called log_tcp,
which consists of a program called tcpd  which is invoked by inetd and
does  some checking (one  of   the things it  checks  (if  you  define
PARANOID) is the very thing that the SUNSECURITY code checks.  It will
also log your connections if you want it to.

Anyway  I was thinking that the  SUNSECURITY code could potentially be
ripped out of the  resolver library and just  include the tcpd code in
the contrib section and direct the sun folks to use it.

Certainly this would be a less messy solution.

We've been using this code for a couple of years  and have not had any
problems   with  it.   I've  included  a   blurb below    if anyone is
interested.

This package provides a couple of tiny programs that log requests for
internet services (examples: TFTP, EXEC, FTP, RSH, TELNET, RLOGIN,
FINGER, SYSTAT). Optional features are: access control based on pattern
matching, and protection against rsh and rlogin attacks from hosts that
pretend to have someone elses host name.

The programs are nothing but small network daemon front ends. By
default, they just log the remote host name and then invoke the real
network daemon daemon, without requiring any changes to existing
software or configuration files.

Connections are reported through the syslog(3) facility. Each record
contains a time stamp, the remote host name and the name of the service
requested. The information can be useful to detect unwanted activities,
especially when logfile information from several hosts is merged.

Enhancements over the previous release are: support for datagram (UDP
and RPC) services, and execution of shell commands when a (remote host,
requested service) pair matches a pattern in the access control tables.
