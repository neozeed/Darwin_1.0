Here's what it took to build BIND on AIX Version 4.

Beta bind 4.9.3 Patch level 32
AIX 4.1.4 with most IBM patches applied
PowerPC C10 Hardware

Building on AIX Version 4

top level Makefile

    line 328 add an addition library so that 'vfork' is available
    <LIBS = -ll -lbsd
    >LIBS = -ll -lbsd

These files need to include select.h
    res/res_send.c
    named/ns_main.c
    tools/nslookup/send.c

    #ifdef (_AIX)
    #include <sys/select.h>
    #endif

These aix include files need to include <sys/types.h> or a bigger sweep
through the bind source needs to done so ensure that types.h is included
before these.

    include/netinet/in.h
    include/sys/sockets.h

    #include <sys/types.h>


Resolver library Makefile

I was surprised to find ld begin called directly in the makefile.

    ld should be replaced with $(LD) and LD should
    be defined in the top level Makefile.   The gnu ld fails on res_debug.o
    so $(LD) should point to the AIX version in /usr/bin/ld.
