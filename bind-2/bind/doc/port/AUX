Paul, I had forgotten that a long time ago, I discovered that starting 
named from the inittab under A/UX didn't work. I kept getting a message 
that it was a "socket operation on a non-socket". Named works fine if 
your start it from the /etc/rc file. Could you add a note for A/UX users 
that they need to disable named starting from /etc/inittab and instead 
start it from /etc/rc?

Thanks.
