Hi again !

Thanks a lot ! You gave me the clue to the AIX C compiler flags !

The top level Makefile says "Supid AIX" and defines "bsdcc" as the compiler
to use. Now, there is no such thing as a bsdcc compiler on a vanilla AIX
system. You have to create a link named bsdcc pointing at your
original C compiler named xlc and create a "flavour entry" in your xlc.cfg
file :

* Berkeley style compiler. Added 931221 by Urban K.
bsdcc:  use             = DEFLT
        crt             = /lib/crt0.o
        mcrt            = /lib/mcrt0.o
        gcrt            = /lib/gcrt0.o
        libraries       = -lbsd, -lc
        proflibs        = -L/lib/profiled,-L/usr/lib/profiled
        options         = -H512,-T512, -qlanglvl=extended, -qnoro, 
                          -D_BSD, -D_NONSTD_TYPES, -D_NO_PROTO,
                          -bnodelcsect, -U__STR__, -U__MATH__

Of course you are right, <sys/param.h> DO include <sys/types.h> if the
_BSD flag is set.
Our problem was that we broke the configuration entry in xlc.cfg into
several lines. That has been done in all other AIX configuration files so 
why not in this one ?

But it did not work, we did not get the _BSD flag set and we did not
even get warned about the configuration mistake.

Your clue togheter with the inctree perl program lead us right. Thanks !
Now, the BETA 6 compiles like a charm with no changes at all.

Yours
