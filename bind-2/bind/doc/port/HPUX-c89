I have just compiled bind-8.2-T5B on HP-UX 10.20 and encountered the
following minor problems. Note that this is using HP's c89 ANSI compiler
rather than the stripped down compiler supplied bundled with the OS.

Changes in port/hpux/Makefile.set:
 'CC=c89 -D_HPUX_SOURCE -z'  # ie choose c89 compiler and adjust options
 'SYSLIBS=-ll'               # no libnsl but doesn't seem to be needed

Somewhere (eg in port/hpux/include/sys/bitypes.h):
#define ORD_16   /* the algorithm in lib/cylink/ctk_endian.h for setting this doesn't work */

Otherwise working nicely. Thanks!
