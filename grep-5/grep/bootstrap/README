If your system is lacking the necessary tools to build the configuration,
Makefile.try is provided for bootstraping. Copy all the source and header
files from grep-${version}/src directory, move Makefile.try to Makefile,
edit the Makefile and type make. Good luck !

cp ../src/*.c .
cp ../src/*.h .
cp Makefile.try Makefile
make
